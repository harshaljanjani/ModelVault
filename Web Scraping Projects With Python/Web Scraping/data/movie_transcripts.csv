,and on those who have made it,will also make as much of an impact,on you,and that you will also like it.,Namaskar.,Do you always carry,these photographs with you?,Yes. Always in my bag.,I never part with them.,I keep them with me.,Just imagine somebody running,with a gun behind my father,,just so that he's dead!,I exactly want to know minute to,minute what happened that day.,Did my father,,on the spot, just fall down?,What did he do? How did it happen?,Where were the dead bodies lying?,What was his expression?,Were his clothes torn?,How much blood went?,And if anybody has clicked,,his dead body's picture,with the blood...,because the photograph I have,,is after he was cleaned.,He was wrapped up in a sheet.,That is what I want to see,,exactly last minute what happened.,May I ask why do you want,to know these details?,Because I want to feel the suffering,my father went through.,On 31st July 1985,,Lalit Maken and his wife,Geetanjali were killed,,at their home in Kirti Nagar,,New Delhi.,Maken was a Congress,Member of Parliament,,and his wife was,a Congress Party worker.,Date was 31st July.,I don't know the exact time,,because I was in school.,I was in Grade One.,And that day,,my cousins Dheeraj and Nidhi,,both were together,,and they were coming down the stairs.,And that day they wanted to,go and see the Parliament.,As we were leaving,,uncle and aunt were a little ahead.,There were two people standing,near a scooter, on our left.,They suddenly took out guns,from a bag,and they started shooting.,Uncle immediately shouted,,""Run inside!"",So I ran up the stairs.,I wasn't the main target.,And right there... downstairs...,they started...,My father passed away,right on the spot.,My mother was still alive.,And hats off,to my paternal grandmother.,She saw her son lying dead.,Immediately,,she picked up her daughter-in-law.,But then, my mother lost her life,,in the hospital, I believe,,in the surgery...,or whatever happened...,And I remember going and kissing her.,Kissing my mother...,And then something like a tear,came out of her eyes.,I don't know medically what it was.,And my uncle wiped the tears.,My maternal grandmother,was a legislator at that time,from Madhya Pradesh.,She came and told me,,""We are taking you along,,but you are not to cry."",And because I promised her,,I didn't cry till they were...,cremated also.,My father used to have,an Ambassador car.,One day, I was sitting in our,Kirti Nagar house, and a car arrived.,And I got up thinking Papa has come,,and then I realized,,""Papa hasn't come... he cannot come."",I live in Ludhiana.,Almost all my childhood,I have lived here,,I have studied in Ludhiana.,I did my Masters,in Genetics and Crop Sciences.,I was a gold medalist in MSc.,Then, after that, I was accepted,for my fellowship for PhD,,in Kansas State in 1985...,when I was completing my MSc.,But, beforehand, because,of the events of 1984,,I had to take a decision.,Either, I go for PhD,,or should I go for the Sikhs.,In 1984, there was rising,disenchantment within Punjab.,And there was a call given by,the Dharam Yudh Morcha,,under the command,of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale,,that from June 3rd,,they're going to start,the civil disobedience movement.,Meaning, we're not going,to give you any tax.,We're not going to sell you,our produce and things like that.,Then, the Government of India, under,the command of Mrs. Indira Gandhi,,who was at that time,the Prime Minister of India,,ordered the Army attack,,on the Golden Temple.,That was in the first week of June.,And a full-fledged army, like,they were fighting an enemy battle.,[Intense gunfire exchange between,Army and militants at Golden Temple],There was total military rule,in Punjab.,Civil administration came,under military rule.,And tanks were put up,in universities and colleges.,Even in women's colleges.,That, I have seen myself.,Then, I started talking,to my close friends.,""What to do?"",Our main issue was,,that Sikhs have lost their dignity.,Their pride has been crushed.,Their identity is under crisis.,These three things,were paramount on my mind.,In between,,Indira Gandhi got killed.,[Mrs. Gandhi is assassinated.,Her son takes over.],[Indira Gandhi, the ruler,of the world's largest democracy],[died today.],[Shot down by,two of her own bodyguards.],[They were Sikhs taking revenge],[for the invasion,of their temple in June.],And it was a sign of jubilation,for Sikhs.,People did stop buses,,and forced people to eat sweets...,Hindu people.,[But already tonight,the tensions between],[the majority Hindus,and the Sikh community, ],[are spilling over into violence.],What we heard,on the next day was that,,Sikhs have been made targets.,And they are being attacked,by the mobs... angry mobs,,which were supposedly Hindu, mostly.,And they were looting,their places of business.,They were destroying their houses.,They were literally,burning Sikhs alive.,That thing shook us.,I went to railway stations to...,to receive people who were coming,from Delhi, from Kanpur,from other places,,as sympathy.,What could we do?,We could just guide them,,help them look,for accommodation somewhere...,whatever it was.,I went to Delhi after 13 days.,I've seen the refugee camps.,At that time around 50,000 Sikhs,were living in refugee camps.,Then, we read that book.,The book came after,a month and a half or so,,'Who Are The Guilty?',It was a fact-finding report.,It came out in the end of November.,And I read it in December of 1984.,In that book,,there was a detailed description,of the events,,after the assassination,of Mrs. Indira Gandhi.,And then they named,the main perpetrators of that carnage,who were the sitting MPs in Delhi,representing the Congress Party.,That made me resolve that,no matter what it takes,we will go after the people,who are behind the riots.,Within, I think, 20th of July,,we were in Delhi.,In one day we could've killed,three of them.,Information was given to us by Sikh,sympathizers inside the Congress.,Then we thought, which could be,the easiest target...,rather than going for all the kills.,For that, Lalit Maken, when,we tracked his house,,where he used to hold,his meetings in Kirti Nagar...,that was the safest.,[Member of Parliament, Lalit Maken,and wife killed],When we killed Maken...,we hit him when he came out.,He was hit eight or nine times,,on the first attempt.,But still, he got up.,He rose up and went,back to his house.,Walked, diligently.,We thought,that we weren't successful.,So, we had to take,a bigger weapon, sten gun.,At that time his wife,,she leapt on him.,She came out of the house?,Yes, she came...,He went inside the verandah.,Inside the house.,Verandah of his house? House...,And she leapt on him.,Meaning she hugged him?,She just lay on him.,She lay on him?,Our people tried to take her aside.,But, they were unsuccessful.,And we were short of time.,Then, there was no option,other than to hit them.,Then he was hit with 28 bullets.,With a sten gun?,Sten gun.,And she?,She was hit, too.,There was an eye for an eye.,We needed it.,That's what you felt?,Yeah, we felt it.,Till date...,my father is...,the main...,He has left a very big vacuum,in my life.,I don't think I can love,any man the way I've...,neither my sons nor anybody.,I am totally my father's daughter.,I was extremely possessive about him.,I couldn't even share him,with my mother.,I used to keep telling him,,""When I grow up,,I am going to marry you."",How old were you when,your parents passed away?,You can say, six.,My birthday was on 10th August.,And at that time if anyone asked me,,""What do you want to be,when you grow up?"",I would say, ""I want to kill,the people who killed my parents."",That anger was definitely there that,,I have to kill these people, anyhow!,Come what may, I have to,avenge my parents.,If I met the killer at that time,,even as a child,,even if I couldn't do anything,I would've wanted,to kill that person.,Suddenly, it happened.,He didn't come home.,We were worried.,The police came asking,,""Where did your son go?"",""How did he become a revolutionary?"",I said,,""I don't know anything about this."",After that,,15 days went by, then a month.,But we couldn't find him.,The police launched,a nationwide manhunt,but Kuki evaded arrest.,Soon, he escaped,to the United States,,with his friend, Sukhi...,Sukhminder Singh Sandhu.,I went to the US,on 28th February, 1986.,We wanted to know,what kind of support we have.,If we're going to fight against the,Indian nation for a separate state,,we need some support...,from somewhere.,Then, we started contacting,the Sikhs,,who were the main, prominent,,protagonists of the Sikh movement.,You can call it the Khalistan,movement or whatever you want.,So, we told them exactly how it is,in Punjab and what we can do,,and we have to seek the support,of the Pakistan government.,Officially.,But Pakistan was not agreeable.,They were asking for money,and other things like that.,So, ultimately,,we told our friends who were,running the movement,,that we had no support.,So, we decided we should go back.,Go back to India.,Let's see.,Whether we live or die,,we will fight for it.,And we got arrested in,the middle of that day.,And that was 14th May, 1987.,Kuki and Sukhi were arrested,by the American authorities,in New Jersey,,just as they were preparing,to fly out of the US.,Firstly, the Interpol warrant,was against us,,for suspicion of being involved,in the conspiracy,,to kill General Vaidya, who was,the Chief of the Indian Army,,during the Indian Army attack,on the Golden Temple.,Secondly, I was...,named in the killing of Lalit Maken.,And Sukhi was charged with,the conspiracy,to kill General Vaidya.,There's a saying,in our holy scripture, the Gurbani,,""Whatever happens is His will."",""Whatever happens is His will."",But my wife, Surjeet Kaur...,she was heartbroken.,He was our youngest child.,She loved him a lot.,When my parents passed away,,my mother's sister, who lives,in Chandigarh, wanted to keep me,,and my father's sister,wanted to keep me, too.,The Sharmas didn't let me,stay with my father's sister.,And the Makens didn't let me,stay with my mother's sister.,They went to court over my custody,,and ultimately no one took me.,I know Avantika since 1987,when she was enrolled,at boarding school,,Maharani Gayatri Devi Girls' School.,It was the first time Avantika,came to a boarding school.,She was very bubbly,and energetic.,We got along very well.,There was a lot of anger in her.,That's something we used to see,because she used to get angry.,But definitely we didn't know,that she had lost her parents.,At least I didn't know, as she,came in earlier, but Shweta knew.,I got to know a little later,,and that's when you realize...,Now we realize that,not having parents is...,it's almost like,the end of the world.,Avantika had brought her mother's,vanity case to school,she was in grade three.,It had lipsticks, nail paints,,as it is.,Yes. Avantika's mother's.,I'm getting goose bumps.,Avantika shared with me that,the day her parents died,,she was sent to school,in the morning.,And her mother was angry,with Avantika for some reason.,Her mother scolded, ""I won't come,to pick you from school today."",And... then the event happened.,So somewhere it was there,in her mind...,""Maybe, if mother hadn't said that,,she might still be here."",On 25th July, 1992,,Avantika's maternal grandfather,,Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma,,was sworn in as,the ninth President of India.,Avantika, then 12 years old,,returned to Delhi to live,with her maternal grandparents,,after having spent four years,at boarding school.,Rashtrapati Bhavan is like,paradise on earth.,The biggest presidential palace,in the world.,I had my own room there.,I learnt how to swim there.,I learnt how to play the piano there.,I learnt a lot.,I travelled a lot.,Because they took me for every trip.,My grandmother was happy that,I had returned from boarding school.,But the people around my grandmother,didn't want me there.,And those relatives didn't want me,to even play with their children.,They used to say,,""Avantika is very rash."",""Avantika is crazy."",Even as a teenager,,I was a topic of discussion.,I still remember,,once I was half asleep,,and some elders of the family,were criticizing me,,and I could hear them.,And I was pretending to be asleep,,because I didn't have the courage,to confront them,,and say, ""I can hear you."",I still remember,,there's a retreat near Shimla,,which is supposed to be the summer,house for the President of India.,I still remember, we went there,,and while walking in the garden,,I said,,""I am missing home a lot."",One of my relatives retorted,,""What home do you have?"",See, however harsh it might sound,,the fact is I'm an orphan.,I've been fond of training,since I was in jail.,Prison walls are such,,that once you enter,,your brain gets shut down.,One layer after another collapses.,To protect yourself,from that collapse,,you have to fill it up,with something.,We were locked up,in a prison within a prison,,on the 9th floor.,It was called,Metropolitan Correctional Center.,It was famously called,,the prison...,where people become dumb,,or they become numb.,American jail life starts,at 6 o'clock in the morning.,First thing, you have to...,you have to go,to take your breakfast.,They give you cereals, porridge,,and two cartons of milk,,and fruit.,After that, either you go back,to your cell,or you are assigned a job...,voluntarily.,I took the job for mopping,and cleaning up of the main floor.,We had a small yard,,where we could do,some push ups, pull ups.,Health-wise, you could exercise.,Otherwise to fill up your mind,,you had to read.,On the surface,it looks very reasonable...,if we compare it to Indian standards.,But, the sense of fear...,the fear of...,being enclosed within 8 to 10 yards.,We were kept in a facility which is,only built for 90 days.,In 90 days,,either your trial is finished...,either you go out,,or you go to the bigger prisons.,Whatever your sentence is.,And you can well imagine,,in that 90-day facility,,I spent 10 years.,I never saw greenery for 10 years.,Birds...,We could see the rain,,but, we couldn't feel it.,Time stops.,If you are sitting in the same room,,day after day,,time stops.,How to survive another day?,It's a day-to-day existence.,And we had no hope,that we would ever come out.,But, in our minds, we had,to keep ourselves alive...,that we will make it,,no matter what happens.,What did you miss the most?,Inside prison?,Freedom.,Nothing compares with freedom.,At that time I thought...,even if they give me,one hour to sit outside,,of the prison,,that will be the biggest moment,of my life.,My grandparents,,paternal or maternal,,deserve a 100 out of 100,,with whatever they have done for me.,But once you start growing up,,that's the time you realize,that you really need parents.,Grandparents can do,whatever best they can do,but nobody can compensate,for parents.,So I think a lot of things,which happened in my life,,whether it was my first marriage,or whatever...,Because getting married,at the age of 18,,and having a baby at the age of 19...,That was, I think, just wanting,to have someone of my own.,I wanted a home of my own,,my own family,,people who would be entirely my own.,When Anirudh was born,,I was so happy.,After I had conceived him, I remember,giving the high school exams.,Anirudh was like...,my child, my blood.,This was when Anirudh,was 40 days old.,After Anirudh was born,,and when I was around 22-23,,my ex-husband kind of deserted me.,So I was on my own and,it was very difficult,,whether it was financially...,because, I didn't have any support,system, be it parents or siblings.,I never wanted Anirudh,to feel left out in any way.,Although I feel extremely sorry...,for Anirudh...,because he has had a very tough life.,So, Anirudh... I just...,Anirudh went through a lot.,I feel very sorry because,,I was very young,,and I couldn't support him,the way I should have.,We always used to be together.,We studied in the same school,,slept in the same room,,till I got married.,He was a lovable,,affectionate brother.,Sometimes naughty.,Every alternate day, he wrote me,a letter, from jail.,With your brother being in jail,,what did you go through?,You know, being a sister,,a lot of things.,I felt very hurt.,Maybe... I was hurt... not knowing,whether I would see him alive again.,Kuki and Sukhi remained in prison,for well over a decade.,First in New York,and then at Otisville.,The Indian government waged a long,legal battle for their extradition.,Sikhs in the United States hired,prominent human rights lawyers,,to defend Kuki and Sukhi.,Eventually,,14 years after his arrest,,Kuki won a judicial victory,in his extradition case.,I got denial of extradition.,The US government acted in my favour.,Sukhi's extradition was granted.,But he could've appealed,to a higher court.,But, by that time,,we had made up our minds.,Whether we win or we lose,,we're going back.,It was 14 years.,We said that we'll face,whatever happens.,We remember the day,he was extradited.,The police were everywhere.,He was taken away in a car.,They told us, ""Kuki is in that car."",We went to meet him the next day.,- Where?,- Tihar jail.,He said, ""No, Devinder.,You should not come here."",I said, ""No, I will come."",That was my first experience,of Indian prisons.,There's just a bare cell.,On a cemented,,lifted bed type of thing,,there are two blankets,,which you can smell,from 15 yards away.,As you know, in India,,the case lingered on.,And the verdict came in 2003.,The judge said, ""Devinder..."",He took father's name too...,""Dr. Gill, Ranjit is convicted."",So Kukiji, the Sessions Court,refused to consider,the 14 years you've spent,in prison in the US.,You were convicted for life.,You tell me, Svati, what to do?,But, he wrote in his judgment,,""No doubt he's a convict,,but he's not a criminal."",""And I urge the government of Delhi,,to sympathetically look at his case,,for early release."",At that time Sheila Dikshit was,the Chief Minister of Delhi.,Judge told me, ""Devinder,,go to Sheila Dikshit"",and ask for his remission."",But, they deferred my case.,Who deferred your case?,Sheila Dikshit.,They had a parole board hearing.,But Avantika Maken did not agree...,to my release.,I lost my childhood,at the age of six.,I have lost everything,,they haven't lost anything.,How can they decide?,Then I called up,Sheila Dikshit's assistant.,I said,,""If you do anything to free him,,I will start a protest,outside the Chief Minister's house."",I said, ""Nothing doing!,He has to go behind bars."",Because I lost my childhood,,I lost my parents.,I have lived with that.,I wanted him to be behind bars.,I went to the extent of saying,,""Why put behind bars? Hang him!"",This is the pendant she was wearing,,when she was shot dead so,you can see the blood here.,Till I am alive,,I will not get it washed.,It was January 2004.,Kuki was serving the fourth year,of his life sentence at Tihar Jail,,when his sister Devinder brought news,that their mother was dying.,My husband did the ultra sound.,We came to know,,nodular liver, which means cancer.,She will live for six months or so.,He gave me a certificate,on Sunday night.,And by Monday my father went,to apply for his bail,in the High Court.,Even then, the judges didn't agree.,My father even put up his,Padmabhushan Award, as guarantee.,They threw it away.,They just threw it away.,Then, by February,,somehow they agreed,,for interim bail of 14 days.,The day he came, we all were,waiting for him.,My husband, myself...,He just entered the house.,Early in the morning.,He was coming back home,after so many years.,After 19 years or so.,He was 23 when he went.,And my brother was 43,when he returned.,We knew our end was either,in the prison,,or die in torture,,or being killed by the police.,I never thought that,I would come back to India.,Or even to my neighbourhood.,Even to my own house.,My husband has also come.,Go, call your father.,Me and Ashokji,are very different people.,He was the President of NSUI and,I was the General Secretary of NSUI,,the frontal student organization,of the Congress Party.,Two things which really attracted me,towards him were...,one, that he was,a very nature loving person.,And he was a very simple man.,And actually... I proposed to him.,I straightaway proposed marriage.,And 30th June we got married.,And we are so close, me and Ashokji,,that any little decision also,people laugh at how we consult,each other.,After his 14-day bail ran out.,Kuki struggled to extend,his parole a few days at a time.,He managed to stay on in Ludhiana,under strict surveillance,,with daily visits,to the police station.,It was around this period,that his family learnt,,that Avantika was visiting Ludhiana.,One of Kuki's friends,,a journalist, Amrita Chaudhry...,she rang me up in May 2004.,She asked me,,""Avantika Maken is here...,for Mr. Manish Tiwari's campaign."",""In Ludhiana."",""For one day."",""Do you want to meet her,,for Ranjit's remission?"",I said, ""Yes.

I keep thinking,of my daughter, Rani.,On the 25th of February, 1995,,Sister Rani Maria,,a 41-year old nun from Kerala,,was stabbed to death near the town of,Udainagar in Madhya Pradesh.,Rani Maria was killed,in broad daylight,while travelling on a bus,,carrying passengers to a nearby city.,That day, Rani Maria,,was to go to Kerala.,So I was waiting for her.,I was in Bhopal,,she was in Udainagar.,She had to travel in the morning,from Udainagar to Bhopal.,So, that night, by Kerala Express,,both of us had to leave for Kerala,for a meeting.,At 12.45, I got the message...,I got the phone call...,I, myself, answered the phone.,Then I was told,,""She was killed.,Rani Maria was killed!"",""And you have to come to Udainagar,,and collect the dead body."",First stabbing was on the hand,,then she was holding the iron bar,,and he kept on stabbing.,Like that... 54 wounds, she got.,Then the driver said,,""Don't do it in the bus."",So he pulled her down.,This is the spot,where she was pulled down.,When this attack took place,,I was at our Provincial House,in Bhopal.,I was ill.,What were you suffering from?,I was suffering from cancer.,I was devastated...,because it was I who had,been counting my days.,I asked God,,""Why did You snatch,my sister away so soon?"",""I have cancer,,I am in a serious condition."",""Why didn't You take me instead?"",""My sister was doing,such good work."",""Why did You take her, God?"",I kept asking God these questions.,""All she did was serve the poor."",""She fulfilled Your will."",""Then why did she meet,with such a fate?"",""Why did You let this happen, God?"",""My sister died all alone,in the forest."",""No one was with her."",""She died inch-by-inch.,Why did You let her die this way?"",I kept asking God these questions.,Today is 25th February.,It's on this day,,that Sister Rani Maria passed away.,Or you may say she was martyred.,And we've all gathered here,to remember her.,I was with her since the year 1990.,Together we had formed,a self-help group,,and we gave small farmers,manure, seeds...,It's impossible to enumerate,,all that Rani Maria did,for our village in five years.,The most important thing she did,,was to solve our severe water crisis.,This whole area was dry.,Women were forced to walk,three kilometers to fetch water.,This water supply system,that you see here,was built with Rani Maria's support.,This tube well here and pipeline,supply water to the entire village.,Even today, the whole village,gets water from here.,Each household has been,given a connection.,The idea was Rani Maria's,,the money came from the government,,and the labour was ours.,Her heart was always,with the underprivileged.,She didn't believe in charity,or giving handouts.,Her goal was to empower people,,and become self-reliant.,The poor people of this area,,used to go to the moneylenders,,to borrow money for cultivation.,The farmers would go,to the moneylenders for loans,,and the moneylenders charged them,double interest rates.,Then my sister told the farmers,about bank loans.,She helped them start,cottage industries.,In these ways people started,saving some money.,Obviously,,the moneylenders and landlords,didn't like this.,She was a hindrance,for the moneylenders,,as their income was decreasing.,That was one of the things.,Then, they thought that we are,converting the people here.,In my village, nobody knows,their exact birth date.,Just a handful may know,the year of their birth.,""The year unseasonal rain,ruined the crop..."",That's how dates are identified.,But I guess I was born in 1966.,I was born here in Semaliya Raimal.,I grew up here.,My entire life,has been spent here...,It happened on 25th February, 1995.,That day I was travelling,from Udainagar to Indore,with some landlords.,Sister also boarded the same bus.,- Sister Rani Maria?,- Yes.,Just a few days prior, a landlord,had been beaten up by some tribals.,The landlords blamed,Sister Rani Maria for the attack.,They told me,,""We were attacked by people,converted by the missionaries,"",and the missionaries,will eventually destroy,""our Hindu organizations,and community."",At first, I was sitting,with the landlords,,on the long passenger seat,in the driver's cabin.,Then, when the landlords,started instigating me,,they said, ""Don't sit with us, other,passengers will get suspicious."",So, I got up and stood near,the entrance.,Then they started signaling me,to attack.,Q: How many shots did you fire?,Kasab: I don't know.,We just kept firing.,Q: Whom were you told to kill?,Q: Whom were you told to kill?,Q: For how long did you,plan to operate today?,They ordered us, ""Until you're alive,keep firing, dogs!"",But I wasn't able to gather,the courage.,I found the courage...,I attacked Sister Rani Maria.,I attacked her with a knife.,I stabbed her once, twice...,then I lost control.,I couldn't stop stabbing her.,It was as if I was possessed.,Had anyone intervened,at that moment,,I would have stabbed them as well.,Until the victim dies,,you can't stop.,What did Sister Rani Maria do?,She kept praying.,She'd realized that the landlords,were behind the attack.,She kept calling out, ""Jesus, Jesus!"",She was calling out to Jesus?,She didn't ask anyone for help.,I was unstoppable,,I dragged her out of the bus.,After dragging her down,,I stabbed her a few more times.,She breathed her last.,In those days,people believed Christians would,forcibly convert all the Hindus,and enslave our country.,I believed that every Hindu,who gets converted,,becomes an enemy of the nation.,There was hardly any newspaper,or television in my village.,One could easily be misled.,And the landlords who were educated,in the cities, would fool us.,They manipulated us.,I trusted them blindly.,I always believed what they said.,The landlords would choose,a gullible villager,,who could easily be conned.,They'd treat you to a few good meals,,give you some importance.,They'd say a few flattering things.,Did they offer bribes?,No. It's not that they offer money.,They just show you rosy dreams.,They make you believe that,you are special and important.,It was all just an illusion.,And ultimately,,the illusion shattered.,Within three days,,the murderers were arrested.,Samundar was the first,to be caught.,The other two were caught,the next day.,A week after my sister's death,,a priest told me,,""Selmi, you shouldn't pursue,the case.,As Christians, we should forgive."",""You should go to prison,,meet them and forgive them."",This was just a week,after the murder.,I was still very angry,,and wanted to pursue the case.,I felt that I was not yet ready,to meet the killer.,Ready, as in...,I needed time to prepare,myself, mentally and spiritually.,Because going to meet him in prison,wasn't an easy thing to do.,I had to prepare myself spiritually.,So I stayed at Udainagar and prayed.,Everyday, I sat in church,and prayed for everyone.,What was the court's verdict?,Life imprisonment.,Life imprisonment?,Life imprisonment.,And what about the landlords,who were with you?,They were also sentenced for life.,Then we appealed to the High Court,,and the landlords got bail,right away.,From the High Court?,Yes, from the High Court.,And my bail was rejected.,For how long were,the landlords behind bars?,Four months in all.,In prison, I kept asking myself,,""Why did I make such a huge mistake?"",""Why did I kill her?"",I couldn't find an answer.,And no matter how deep my regret,,it wasn't going to bring Sister,back to life.,I had blinding headaches.,When I tried to read,the newspaper, I couldn't.,My vision would blur with tears.,One day, a High Court judge came,to visit the prison.,I pleaded with him,,""Sir, I am disturbed and depressed,,and my family members are starving."",The judge said just one thing,,""Imagine the suffering you inflicted,on the person you killed."",""Imagine the suffering,of her family members."",""If you pick up a cane,and hit yourself with it,,won't you feel pain?"",""Now, imagine the pain,the person you killed went through."",That day I realized,,my troubles were nothing,,compared to the excruciating pain,,I had put Sister Rani Maria through.,Look, it's hardly grown.,How will these onions grow,when there isn't enough water...,The water supply has reduced further,since the last 15 days,,and if even this dries up,,what will I do?,In the years after,her sister's murder,,Selmi won her battle against cancer,,and became a teacher,at the Rani Maria Memorial School.,And to build the fortitude,to forgive her sister's killers,,she continued to seek strength,in prayer.,""Lord, have mercy on them."",God is merciful... but I should also,feel like being merciful.,That's what I prayed for.,Seven years went by.,Then, in the year 2002,,a Catholic priest,called Swami Sadanand,,reached out to Sister Selmi,and Samundar.,Swami Sadanand had been working,for several years with convicts,,in the prisons of Madhya Pradesh.,Swamiji, what do you tell prisoners,when you visit them in jails?,First I sing a few bhajans.,Then I ask them,,""Is it better to inhale or exhale?"",First they say, ""Inhaling is better."",Then they say, ""Exhaling is better."",Then they agree that both are equal.,Then I ask them,,""Is day better or night better?"",Some say day, some say night.,Then all agree both are equal.,""Is summer better or winter better?"",""Both are equal."",In the same way,,in life, joy and sorrow are equal.,Until you accept them both as equal,,you cannot truly become,a human being.,So I say,,if inhaling and exhaling are equal,,if joy and sorrow are equal,,enemy and friend are also equal.,Both are just an experience.,Accept them both as an experience.,Only then can you rise above them.,One day, in prison,,the Jailor sent for me.,He said, ""Someone has come,to see you."",I asked, ""Who is it?"",""Some monk,"" the Jailor replied.,I knew nothing about,Swami Sadanandji at that time.,I bowed and paid my respects,to the monk.,Then, I asked who he was and,where he had come from.,The monk introduced himself,as Sister Rani Maria's brother.,He said he wanted to speak to me.,A chill ran down my spine.,I wondered why Swamiji,had come to meet me,though I'd committed,such a terrible crime!,The next time Swamiji came, he said,,""Sister Selmi would like to,tie you a rakhi."",I said,,""Swamiji, how is that possible?"",""How can I stand before Sister?"",""What will I say?"",""How will I explain,what I have done?"",On July 15, 2002, I received,a phone call from Swamiji.,I had never met or,spoken to Swamiji before that.,He asked me, ""Are you willing,to meet Samundar in jail?"",I replied, ""Swamiji, this is what,I've been waiting for."",""I am prepared."",July 20, 2002... Rakhi.,I didn't know much about rakhi,as it isn't a custom in Kerala.,I'd only heard about it...,knew that it signifies,a bond between brother and sister.,I just kept praying for Samundar,and blessing him,as I sat in the car.,I wasn't in the mood to speak,to anyone.,As soon as we reached the prison,,a policeman took me inside.,Another policeman,brought Samundar out.,I had never seen him before.,Swamiji said, ""This is Samundar."",Samundar was trembling.,Then Swamiji introduced me,to Samundar,,""This is Rani Maria's,younger sister."",Samundar said,,""Forgive me... forgive me."",""I made a big mistake.,I'm repenting now."",I said to him, ""God has already,forgiven you."",""I had also forgiven you."",""It has just taken me,some time to come and meet you."",""Please be at peace."",The police didn't give us,a lot of time.,So I quickly tied,the rakhi on his wrist.,Yes, I did.,I had brought sweets,from the Convent.,When I offered him some,,Samundar took it from my hand,and fed me a piece,,and then gave everyone a bit.,I don't know why...,it brought me great joy.,A brother, feeding,his sister sweets...,it was a blissful moment.,That was a happy day,and a terribly sad one, too.,There were a few moments of pure joy,,and some moments of intense grief.,Grief, because here I was, the man,who'd killed her elder sister.,And yet, she'd tied me a rakhi,,when in fact,,I don't even deserve to live.,But I had promised to accept the,brother-sister bond rakhi signifies.,No matter how ashamed I felt,,I had to live with it.,And then I also felt happy.,The happiness came from the fact,,that despite the crime,I had committed,,Sister Selmi made me her brother...,gave me another chance at life.,No sister would want her brother,to be in prison,,then how could I allow it.,If I have truly forgiven him then,I should not allow him,to be in prison.,I felt that from within.,So, I asked Swamiji, ""What can we do,for Samundar?"",Swamiji was already prepared.,Within months of her visit to jail,,Sister Selmi,with Swami Sadanand's help,,initiated legal processes,for the remission,of Samundar Singh's life sentence.,In the year 2006,,Samundar was released,from prison, permanently.,Soon after his release,,Samundar journeyed across 2000 kms,,from Madhya Pradesh to Kerala.,Samundar came home with Swamiji.,He reached Kerala.,In Kerala, I saw tears,in Sister Rani Maria's parents' eyes.,There were tears in her brother,Stephen's eyes.,I was so distressed,,I didn't know what to do.,I had no answers.,My mind just stopped working...,because it was beyond,my worst imagination.,When Samundar entered,my sister's room,he broke down,in front of her photograph.,He was inconsolable.,Then mother said,,""I have forgiven you completely."",""You are my son, now."",She accepted him as her third son.,This pond is thousands of years old.,Compared to that,,we humans live momentarily.,We are fortunate to be born,as humans.,And as humans, if we,behave like brutes, then...,It's impossible for me,to forgive myself.,What right do I have,to forgive myself?,No one has the right to commit,a crime and then forgive himself.,Yes, if you do a lot of good deeds,,there may be some redemption.,But not complete forgiveness.,Six minutes back... an explosion,and we have the pictures there,,on your screens as you can see.,In fact it was not an explosion,but you can see fire,,coming out of the top,of the dome of the old Taj hotel,,and a huge plume of smoke.,On that day, Oprah Winfrey was,gonna be on at 4 o'clock.,So I was making tea,and getting some cheese and crackers,ready and all of that.,And then the phone rang,in my mother's kitchen.,I was nearby so I just picked it up.,And it was the Managing Director,of Synchronicity,,Bobby Garvi.,And she said, ""Kia, you have to,turn on the news right away."",And she said, ""The Oberoi hotel,is being attacked by terrorists."",On 26th November, 2008,,ten members of Lashkar-e-Toiba,,an Islamic terrorist organization,based in Pakistan,,carried out a series,of co-ordinated shooting,,and bombing attacks in Mumbai.,The terrorists targeted 12 locations,in the southern part of the city.,These included,Mumbai's iconic train station,,Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus,,Cama and Albless Public Hospital,for Women and Children,,a popular bar and restaurant,called Leopold Cafe,,the Jewish Community Centre,,and two of Mumbai's,top five star hotels...,The Taj and the Oberoi Trident.,At first they weren't mentioning,Oberoi. It was all about the Taj.,But then, as it went on, they started,mentioning other locations.,The train station, Leopold's, and,then they did mention Oberoi hotel.,Kia Scherr, her husband Alan,and their daughter Naomi,,lived in Virginia,,and were part of a meditation,community called Synchronicity.,In the middle of November 2008,,Kia was in the US,,visiting her parents,for Thanksgiving,,while Alan and Naomi came to Mumbai,for a group meditation retreat.,The group's Indian hosts,,had organized their stay,at the Oberoi Trident.,And I was speculating,what time it was...,they must be in their rooms.,Just kept saying, ""They must be,in their rooms, by now."",""I'm sure they're fine.,They're in their rooms."",Late on the evening of the 26th,,Alan, Naomi and a few members,of the meditation group,,Helen, Michael and Linda,,had settled down to have dinner at,the Oberoi's Tiffin restaurant.,Much later we got another call,,from Bobby and she said that,,""This is what we know so far."",""That everybody in the group,has been accounted for."",""But... we're not sure,about Alan and Naomi."",And I said, ""What do you mean?"",She said, ""Well, we know that,Alan took a shot to the head."",""And Naomi was last seen hiding under,the table. That's what we heard..."",""But nothing's been confirmed and,we don't know... we don't know."",The terrorists claimed 164 lives.,Over 300 people were injured,,several grievously.,The terror ended,after 60 agonizing hours.,6 am...,The phone rings.,Let's see... that was Friday. So it,would have been Friday late...,early evening,,late afternoon in Mumbai.,And it was a woman,from the US Consulate.,And she just...,I feel really bad for her that,she had to do this but...,that was her job and she said,,""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Scherr."",""Your husband and daughter were both,shot and killed in the restaurant."",And I couldn't believe it.,I said, ""Both of them?"",'Cause I figured...,I was kind of thinking,,""Okay, I'm going to have to accept,that Alan might not have made it."",But because Naomi,was hiding under the table,,never in a million years,did I ever think...,that she, too...,I just couldn't believe it.,So it was like... I just kept saying,,""Both of them? You sure?"",And she just... what could she say.,She said, ""I'm so sorry."",They're over in India and...,what do you...,and anyway... it's just...,Like there's nothing to say.,And then we just wanted to...,I don't know... for some reason,we just kept staring at this...,whatever information we could get.,The news...,Yes, and we still kept,just staring at the news,,and that's when I saw,for the first time,,the face of Ajmal Kasab.,This young man... holding the gun,at the train station.,As the city laid its martyrs to rest,,a bustling metropolis,was plunged into mourning.,I think it was so big. I...,just a state of shock and you go into,a surreal kind of a state,,because it was too big,to even process really.,Of course, I broke down and cried,,but I wasn't sobbing constantly,for days,because I couldn't, I was in shock.,But then I had to go and...,pack up things.,I had to look at photographs,and stuffed animals,,and drawings and books, clothing...,and I had to do all of that.,And there was this giveaway shed,,near where we were living,,where you could just,bring things in the shed,,and people could go take what they,needed and they might bring things.,One day I went with a box,of Naomi's clothes.,And there was a woman there and she,recognized me from the newspaper,,and she knew exactly...,I'd never met her before.,And she just looked at that box,cause it was sort of still open,on top and saw,,t-shirts and jeans,and all this and...,She said, ""I know you."",And she just gave me a big hug.,Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus,had suffered the maximum number of,casualties during the terror attack.,Ajmal Amir Kasab,,who with his partner,,had killed 58 people,at the train terminus,,was the lone terrorist,captured alive.,Q: What is the name,of your organization?,Kasab: Lashkar-e-Toiba.,Q: Any other organization?,Kasab: No,,just Mujahideen Lashkar-e-Toiba.,Q: Who are your family members?,Kasab: My mother, my sister.,Q: What's your mother's name?,Kasab: Noor Ilahee.,Q: What's your father's name?,Kasab: Amir.,What was his occupation?,He sold street food in our village,and then in Lahore.,But he couldn't make ends meet.,Q: How much have you studied?,Kasab: I studied till,the fourth grade.,Q: What did you do,after leaving school?,Kasab: I started working,as a labourer.,I first worked in the village,and then in Lahore.,I lifted cement and bricks...,Q: You were on a building site?,Yes. But I was not getting,enough work to make a living.,Then my father introduced me,to the Lashkar-e-Toiba.,Q: How?,My father said,,""Look son, we are very poor.,If you work with them,"",""you will earn enough money to live,comfortably like them."",""It's not difficult."",""We will get money.,We won't remain poor."",""Your siblings will be,able to get married."",""Look son"",""you will also earn,and live comfortably like they do."",Q: How did they describe Jihad,to you?,""It's honourable,,it's like serving God."",That's what they said.,Q: If you hadn't been captured,by the police,,you would have died, isn't it?,Q: Why were you ready,to sacrifice your life?,Q: Surely it was something,more than money.,Sir, it's nothing other than poverty.,Poverty is a terrible thing.,When you have nothing to eat, nothing,to wear, what else can you do?,Q: How much did they transfer,to your account?,I don't have an account.,They paid my father.,Q: How much did they give him?,I don't know, may be lakhs.,Q: Do you think your father has,this much money right now?,Maybe... he might.,Q: So, your father used you, right?,Kasab: Whatever you say, sir.,Q: You were here for Jihad, right?,What Jihad, sir!,Look, there is no point crying now.,Just tell us the whole truth.,As you say, sir.,Q: How many shots did you fire?,Kasab: I don't know.,We just kept firing.,Q: Whom were you told to kill?,Q: For how long did you,plan to operate today?,They ordered us, ""Until you're alive,keep firing, dogs!"",Q: That's what they said?

Banking on Africa: The Bitcoin Revolution (2020) - full transcript,,"- How you feeling?,- Very excited.,Making history.,And also, there's gonna be a lot,of very pleased people at the school.,It's not just a tech thing.,It's not just a new invention.,It's something that can,actually help real people.,So, it's fun to do that and exciting.,It gives it all meaning,,not just interest.,- Living at,the bottom of Africa,
,
,
,can really make world,affairs feel like things,that just happen somewhere else.,So in 2014, when I heard the,word Bitcoin for the first time,I made it my mission to find out,what is so wrong with the way things are,that people are trying,to change the financial,system for everyone.,The thing about storytelling though,,the story you expect is,never the one you find.,I reached out to friends to find out,who knew about this thing called Bitcoin,and I was pointed in the,direction of Lorien Gamaroff.,Within four minutes of receiving my email,about being interviewed on Bitcoin,,
,
,
,Lorien responded, saying,,""Yes, I do believe that,this will impact our lives,""as much as the internet has done."",So can you first explain to,me what cryptocurrency is?,- All it is, essentially, is,a mechanism for being able,to transfer digital assets,without there having,to be a duplicate of that digital asset.,I'll give you an example.,If you have an MP3, or a digital photo,,it's very easy to make a copy,of that digital photo or MP3,and send it to multiple friends,,or what this term is called, double spend.,In 2008, an anonymous,developer, or engineer,,or financial guru devised a way,to create a digital currency,,which essentially solved that problem,,where you could create a digital asset,that could be transferred,from entity to another,and couldn't be easily copied.,In 2011, I read a blog,about an underground website,that was using this new internet,currency that was different,from any other currency that,had ever come before it,,and I immediately decided to,try and play around with it,and see where it would go,,and acquired a number of them,,when they were worth very little.,And then, over the years I've,just seen the usage explode,and people come around to the idea,that this could very will,be the next innovation,that disrupts and upturns our lives,,and has a massive positive impact.,- There are thousands of,cryptocurrencies out there,and they're quite diverse in terms,of what their intentions are,and what they were designed to do.,So, for me the discussion,begins with Bitcoin.,It's the the proto cryptocurrency.,It's the first one that mattered.,- When you first geek out about Bitcoin,,and blockchain, and cryptocurrency,,you tend to become very,excited about the tech itself,,and I think I made the mistake,quite a few times early on,of getting too technical,when I'm just speaking,to my mum, or my wife, or friends,who just want to understand how it works.,It's digital money.,- In 2016,,we attended the Bitcoin,and Blockchain Africa Conference,,so we could hear people,who get it, explain it.,There was a woman on stage from,Botswana who educates people,on both the potential,and risks of Bitcoin.,After she shared her personal story,,I snuck over and slipped a,piece of paper into her hand,with the hastily scrawled words,,I'm making a documentary and,I would love to interview you.,- Come, come, come.,Welcome to my farm.,This is a very small farm,that I started in 2017,,when the Bitcoin market went a bit up.,I managed to buy the goats,and I bought myself some chickens,,and I set up the farm.,And I also managed to buy myself this car.,That is why it has got all,these Bitcoin stickers.,You can come and check out my goats.,They are like way cool.,The other ones are not yet here.,I think they're still in the bush.,The humble beginnings.,I'm hoping in the future,I'll have much, much wider farm,as I continue in my journey of Bitcoin.,So this is a Bitcoin farm.,But instead of mining,Bitcoin, I'm mining goats.,The piece of land, I got it in 2011,,so from 2011 until 2017,there was nothing happening.,I couldn't clean it up,because I didn't have money.,Some of my goats are coming.,It's one of my passions,besides teaching people about Bitcoin.,My husband is the one,who is always coming here,most of the time,because as for me, I'm always,busy doing my education,and doing my Satoshi Centre,,and sometimes touring.,People have flooded,Africa with a lot of scams,and a lot of our people are,falling into those scams.,So I'm not basically,only focused on Botswana.,Where education is needed, I go.,The whole idea of the farm,is so that I can be,able to sustain myself.,I'm just educating people,without making any profit out of it.,For me, education is very important,even though I get stressed,when my life is not,working according to plan,,and my vision for the Satoshi Centre,is not really accomplished, I would say,,but I'm always grateful,for the Bitcoin community,because they are really,a super, amazing family.,Everyone in the Bitcoin,space, they're amazing.,- The original document,that outlined the vision to,reinvent the world of finance,and technology was released in 2008,against the backdrop of,the financial crisis.,In order to understand all of that,,the most obvious place to start was money.,What is money?,Where did it come from?,And why isn't the way it,works working for us anymore?,- One of the first things,we figured out to do,that really distinguished us,from the other animals on this,planet was invent language,and a way of communicating with each other,that could convey very complicated ideas.,We could have armies of 100s,or 1000s of individuals,,where other great apes would only be able,to organize in clusters of,up to about 100 individuals.,So, that gave us an edge.,Language was extremely powerful,as an organizing mechanism,,but the thing we needed next was a way,of making our trust in,each other portable.,We used seashells.,Baboon bones were a popular,form of currency in Africa,,but money is, and always has,been, a form of an IOU note.,I could give you something,and you could trust that,that thing had value because,society believed it did.,Things like dollars and rands,,we call those fiat currencies,and fiat is a Latin word,that means 'let it be done'.,It basically means that they have value,because governments say they do.,Governments tell us that,you will use this money.,You will accept it as repayment of debt,and you will pay your,taxes in this currency.,So, it really is just,is because we say so.,There was a period where fiat currencies,were backed by the gold standard,,and now really money is just backed,by a government's ability,to enforce taxation,within its borders.,Governments, or their,central banking authorities,,can print as much money as they want to.,The decision to print money,is something that lies,with a few individuals.,It's open to flawed decision,making and really it's fair,to say that fiat money,isn't backed by anything.,- For a time,,Bitcoin felt like a lot of talk,and very little action,,but Lorien was taking,Bitcoin out of academia,,out of the future,,and creating a real,world use for it in 2015,,something tangible for the world to see.,- If you consume electricity,,you're gonna have a meter,installed at your property.,There's two modes that,that meter can be in,,either postpaid or prepaid.,Postpaid is where you,just consume the utility,and at the end of the,month somebody will come,and read your meter and,then send you a bill,and then you pay.,You're consuming first and then you pay.,Now prepaid meters are,trying to solve the problem,where people are consuming,and then not paying,,which is a problem we have,,and it's showing itself,in our energy provider,,Eskom, where they say,they don't have enough money,to maintain the power stations,because they can't recover,from the municipalities.,The municipalities can't recover,because nobody wants,to pay for the utility.,They've already consumed it.,So, they're trying to close that gap,by switching all their,customers on to prepaid,,so they can't consume unless they've paid.,But it then introduces another problem,from a consumer's point of view.,At least 80% of Africans are unbanked.,If they want to make a,payment they have to use cash.,Obviously now, the costs are increased,because the vendor has costs,,and there's traveling,costs, security costs.,So, although prepaid systems,will solve the recovery from,the utility's point of view,,it doesn't solve anything from,the consumer's point of view.,Bitcoin is a payment system,,which is an electronic payment system,,that is outside of the banking system.,Anybody who has an app,on their mobile phone,,it doesn't even have to be a smartphone,,they can easily become,part of the Bitcoin economy,and have access to electronic payments.,So, it's just a common sense,thing if you think about it,,that being able to make,Bitcoin a payment method,for a pre-payment system,opens up that massive market,,and it has opportunity to,drastically reduce costs,and increase efficiency,,at least from the,perspective of the consumer.,So now, there's a solution, Bitcoin,,and applied to smart metering,can solve a massive,problem throughout Africa,as well as Latin America and Asia Pacific.,- I started my journey with Bitcoin,in a little bit of a sad way.,- Can you tell me that story?,- My son, right here on the wall.,In 2007, I gave birth to a baby boy.,His name was called,Pako, which means praise.,He was born with a heart defect,called hypertrophic,obstructive cardiomyopathy.,I was looking for ways in,which I can raise money,and probably take him overseas.,It was kind of difficult here in Botswana,for them to promise me anything.,One time, the doctor told me,that there's literally,nothing that they can do.,When we brought to South,Africa, I was very happy.,I said my son would get help.,But they said to me, ""For us,to be able to help your son,,""we finish first with the,list that is in South Africa,""for children who need transplants."",So I went online to try and do freelancing,so maybe I can be able to raise more funds,to be help my child.,Then I remember I got across a survey,where they say you can do a survey,and you can be paid in Bitcoin.,I went through that, worked my heart out.,I never got any Bitcoins,from the work that I did.,A lot of things that I met were scams.,One scam after another.,And then in April, on the,4th, my son died, so yeah.,The first time I heard about Bitcoin,was to raise money for my son.,So when he died, I felt,like I have lost the purpose,for why I should work online.,So I just stopped.,Something was just nagging me in my head,,like you need to go back,to that Bitcoin thing,and look at it and see if,it can be of any worth.,The more I read, the more I get learned.,I decided let me take,another step further.,It's no longer about my son,,now it's about changing my country.,It's about changing the people.,I will group together people,and I will teach them about Bitcoin.,So 2013, I did my first meet-up.,But before the meet-up, I did a video,,which I put on YouTube.,I did an old t-shirt,with my Bitcoin address,and I was like, I want,to work for this company.,Even by then I don't even,understand what Bitcoin was.,Like for me, it was more like a company.,Then 2014, my group was growing,and I kept on educating,people about Bitcoin,from that moment onwards.,- So why can,we trust that crypto,is worth something?,- Bitcoin, as a primary,example, has a finite supply,,which makes it a deflationary currency.,It actually in very real,terms is scarcer than gold.,There's no central,authority that can decide,to raise interest rates,or to print more money,as a part of quantitative easing.,The Bitcoin network runs itself.,Once the network was set in motion,,that system runs by consensus.,- Can you tell me about Usizo?,- Sure, imagine,a poor school in Africa.,They have a Bitcoin meter.,Anybody from anywhere,in the world could pay,for a week or month's worth of electricity,directly without having to,go to that organization.,I actually thought instead of,just talking about something,,why don't I go and do it?,- What does Usizo mean?,- Usizo is a Zulu word, it means help.,The whole point of this project,is to kind of relieve the,burden of the electricity.,I mean, obviously,there's a lot more things,to be paid for in the school,and these schools have small budgets.,If they can have that,burden lifted a little,,where they don't have to,actually pay for the utilities,,then they can then spend,what little they have,on other things.,One of the struggles that we've had,is trying to get a metering,company to agree to the project.,A lot of these metering,companies make a lot of money,on the vending solutions they've supplied,,taking the fees from,the fiat transactions.,Now, having a,blockchain-based system means,that the funds go directly,through to the meter,,and so the metering companies,that we've been dealing with,weren't willing to go,along with the project.,So, it was quite an uphill struggle,,but luckily we have found,some enlightened partners.,We've got about two bars out of the three.,So, I think communication should be fine.,But we also have an antenna.,So what we can do is perhaps,bring an antenna through here,just to boost the signal.,So, once we get the,donation going through,,and the meter can pick up the,payment on the blockchain,,the next step is for the,actual meter to switch on,,and then we should see,the school light up.,It will be hard to see now,,but at least we'll see something happen,,and then on Monday night,when it's all pitch-dark,,I think it'll be quite spectacular,,when everything goes on.,That's the theory, very exciting.,- The blockchain is the,operating system that it runs on.,So, you can see it as your Windows,,or your Linux, or macOS X.,The software layer is the blockchain,and Bitcoin is an app that,runs on top of the blockchain.,- Blockchain is,the magic behind the money,,but really it's just a,decentralized database,stored on a very large network,of computers all over the world.,It is the technology,that underpins Bitcoin,and other cryptocurrencies,,but it's not just for,monetary transactions.,You can use it to store,data like patents or wills,,or to exchange anything of value,,such as products, properties,,services and even votes.,The authenticity of the exchange,of value, or transactions,,is verified by the community as a whole,,rather than by a single,entity, removing the risk,of a single point of,failure in the system.,Each transaction is recorded,on a public distributed ledger,that can be viewed by anyone in the world.,- The blockchain is a,decentralized system,,and the strength of the blockchain,is that everybody's,checking everybody else.,No single institution is in,charge of this information.,Now that differs from the,current financial system,that we actually do,have all over the world.,In the case of South Africa,,in the center of our financial system,,is the South African Reserve Bank.,And the Reserve Bank,checks all the other banks,,and all the other banks check us.,And that's the difference,between a decentralized system,,the blockchain, for example,,and a centralized system.,If I, for example, want to,give you government money,,or Central Bank money, and I do a transfer,from my cellphone to your cellphone,,it is impossible for me to transfer money,from one bank account directly,into another bank account.,We think that is what happens,,but what really happens is that,I send a message to my bank,,which will send a message,to the Central Bank,,which will send a message to your bank,to make a deposit into your bank account.,So there's somebody else always in charge.,There's always a middle man somewhere,between my account and your account.,- So who invented,blockchain and Bitcoin?,- The creator of Bitcoin,,the cryptocurrency,and the technology, is Satoshi Nakamoto.,People think it's a group of people,,or it could be an individual,,he's a complete mystery.,No-one knows who he is.,People have their suspicions.,I have my suspicions as well.,Several people have come out,to claim that they are Satoshi Nakamoto.,I think it's quite nice,that it's a mystery.,I like the fact that,I don't know who it is,and I think we would be disappointed,if we found out who it was.,- So why did,you name your dog Satoshi?,- Bitcoin and cryptocurrency,,and blockchain technology,has taken over my life.,I love Bitcoin, I really do,,and I like what it stands for,,and the name suits him completely.,- I'll organize small,talks and I'll go around.,I've been in Gabarone,,and I went to Francestown,to go and teach people about Bitcoin.,I met students who are into IT.,We talked blockchain and all that,and I began to tell them,about the possibility,of changing the way,things are in our country.,The way things are in the world.,I was inspired by Satoshi Nakamoto,,liberating the people,from what was happening,during the financial crisis,,coming up with something that,would really help people.,The Satoshi Centre's vision,was to create a community lab,where people can come,and learn about Bitcoin,and also be able to be very creative.,- Somebody came up with this,idea of making it possible,to trust the record of ownership of money,,without trusting any,individual in the ecosystem,that makes things work together,and that is such a clever invention,,that we have to make it work,and make it valuable in the,way we apply it to society.,If you compare it to the,traditional financial system,,I don't think any of us really get excited,about going to our bank,,or excited about logging,onto a banking system.,One of the disadvantages of cryptocurrency,is the complexity stall,,that we're working with a,very rough, technical thing,where you need to understand things,like the transaction fees,and things like that.,But, to be fair, if you compare it,to the traditional financial system,,that's not really clear as crystal either.,It's really very difficult to understand,how banking fees are,going to apply to you,,what's it going to cost,to transfer 10 000 rands,to a U.S. bank account.,Things like that are,also very, very complex.,- What we're gonna,basically do is an auction.,The item in question is this over here,,which is a 100 rand note.,You're gonna be bidding,for this 100 rand note.,It's a standard auction.,Whoever wins the auction,gets the 100 rand note.,A slight switch though on,the traditional auction model,is that the person who comes second,has to pay whatever their bid was,,but they don't get the note.,So, I'm gonna open it up at 10 rand.,Would anybody pay me 10,rand for a 100 rand note?,Who's first?,10 rand, we got 10 rand in the back.,180 rand going once,,180 rand going twice.,Sold for 180 rand.,You can come and settle afterwards,and the person who came second,needs to settle with me as well.,It's not that central financial,authorities were a bad idea.,It gave us a way of scaling up to what now,is the global financial system.,It gave us a way of,trading with each other.,You could travel to the,other side of the world,and you could start to,trade with people there,,and that was fantastic,,but where it has failed us,,for example, is where,human greed has been able,to manipulate the system,,to put it quite bluntly.,That's the second highest price,I've ever gotten for a 100 rand note.,It's a great game for me,because I essentially,now have made 310 rand,and parted with 100 rand, right?,The game of course is rigged.,It's designed so that I'm gonna win,and it has to do with,the irrational mindset,people have around money.,We all remember what happened,with the financial crisis in 2009.,In that situation, we were reminded again,that banks can fail.,We have a fractional,reserve banking system,in most countries where,banks don't actually,have to have all of the money,that they're storing on,behalf of their customers,,they only need to keep,enough of that money around,that they can satisfy all,of the withdrawals requested,in any given period.,When a bank gives you a loan,to buy a house, for example,,they don't have to have that money either.,That's basically money they,can make out of thin air.,But when you have a run on the bank,,when there's a crisis,and everybody tries to pull their money,out of the banking,system at the same time,,banks don't have that money,and that causes them to collapse.,Governments then stand,as what we call a lender of last resort.,So, governments say, if the,bank doesn't have enough money,to sort out all of its customers,,we'll step in and we'll lend,them the money to do that.,But, of course, that money needs,to come from somewhere too,,and so what happened in,2009 was you had banks,,which didn't have enough money,to pay all of the people,trying to withdraw their money.,The U.S. government,didn't have enough money,to act as a lender of last resort,,and so, the U.S. taxpayer,effectively had to bail out a bank,with a tax-free, non-reversible loan,that never had to be paid,back to the taxpayer.,Now, it doesn't really matter,how you present that story.,It doesn't strike me as fair.,- Every country's,economy is intertwined,with every other country's economy,,imports, exports, investments,,and the world reserve currency,,meant that the financial crisis in America,became the global financial crisis.,The saying before 2008,was that the banks were too big to fail,,but the bigger they are,,the harder they fall.,Over a decade later,,there are now banks that are even bigger,than the too-big-to-fail banks,of the financial crisis years.,- Hi, my name is Bheki Mahlobo,,and I have a question,for the chief economist.,So, I'm an economics student,,and I'm not sure if you've noticed,,but a lot of people in the Bitcoin space,,they know more about economics,than most PhD students,in universities actually.,This is because in university,we're not particularly exposed,to different, other schools,of economic thought,,like the Austrian school,of economics, for example,,and if we're not exposed to certain things,then we won't question certain things,,for example, like money.,In school we're not particularly,taught what money truly is.,What is your opinion of Bitcoin being used,as a way to escape this,economy that exists right now?,- You're absolutely right,that in our universities,we should teach other,schools of thought as well,,and a very important school of thought,is the school of thought of real freedom.,And I've got a suspicion.,This new technology will,really put the power,in the hands of the individuals,and allow us to experience,that real, real freedom,and not to enslave us the way,that politicians have been enslaving us,for the last couple of hundred years.,This is a real freedom,,but not only is it real freedom,,it's very, very dangerous and with that,,goes a huge responsibility as well.,- 21-year-olds don't normally,go to events like we did the other day.,- Yeah, yeah.,- That's not a,normal 21-year-old thing to do.,- Usually like clubs,and stuff, right, yeah.,The first time I heard about Bitcoin,was from a movie called 'Dope'.,This movie doesn't cover,Bitcoin in a positive light.,And then, I heard it again, and I was like,maybe let me look at it and,do a little bit more research,,and that's where I fell,down the rabbit-hole,as the saying says.,My economics teacher,was heavily into gold.,So he was explaining,central banking, right,,and fractional reserve banking,,and inside I was like whoa,,this seems a little bit shady.,He explained that we actually,don't need the system.,In a normal economy things are supposed,to get cheaper over time,,not expensive over time,,and the common thing that,I'm hearing on the news,or YouTube is that no, we need inflation,so that there's economic growth.,I did a little bit more digging,and then that's when I found Mises.,They follow the Austrian,school of economics,,and then they explain that no,,we actually don't need,inflation for economic growth,,and, in fact, that whole statement,is a whole contradiction in itself.,When you define economic growth,it's the increase in production,,and the increase in production,causes prices to decrease.,An example of this would be technology.,When the first phone came,out it was quite expensive,and then eventually,there was a lot of people,contributing to different designs,,basically providing,alternatives to smartphones,and then the prices of,smartphones decreased over time.,That also could apply,to the economy as well,,and now I know, this person,,what he's saying on TV,,is utter nonsense.,And then, what can I do about it?,It's like buy Bitcoin, bruh.,- Using this greedy algorithm,I can make a lot of money,,and actually the only way,you could've won that game,was to not play it.,The problem is, when you,have money on the table,human beings start acting,in a very curious way,,but I wanna use this auction as an example,of our banking system,,and, in fact, the financial system,that runs the world today.,Because it is rigged.,There are rules that have,been put in place that mean,that you will lose every time you play,and somebody will make a lot of money,because they control the algorithm,that ensures that you lose.,Our current banking systems,,while they're useful for,things like being carrots,and going to the movies and stuff,,are exploitive, and they're exclusionary,,and they cut out a lot of the world,,and we don't have to play the game anymore,because we have the,technology now to opt out.,Money was always centralized,,was always opaque,,was always exclusionary,,had too many middlemen,,too many rent-seekers, too,many people quite frankly,benefiting from exploiting others.,Finally, we could use the internet,to create a financial system,that benefited everybody potentially,,that was resistant to censorship,,that nobody could take control of,,that's what the world had been waiting for,and finally it arrived,with the Bitcoin network.,- I was never interested,in all these subjects,,this economics and finance,,and since Bitcoin I became interested,,and I would still be,living in my oblivious way,,hoping that whoever's running,the system is running it fine,and that we don't end up in the same way,that Zimbabwe ended up where,their money became worthless.,It's not so much about not,having a long-term view,,it's just about being educated on this,and the majority of people,aren't educated on this.,- Can I just go on and say something else,that I think it is important?,- Absolutely, absolutely.,- Okay, if we use a blockchain system,,the power is actually where,I believe it should be,and that's in the hands,of the individuals.,We do not need the,permission to transfer money,between my account and your account.,And that, of course, also,opens the possibility,for things like, for example, fraud,and tax evasion and all,sort of illegal things.,And the responsibility,is also in the hands,of the individuals, the,way I believe it should be.,- Why?,Why should we have that,kind of responsibility?,- In all instances when governments,got involved with money,,in all instances without,one single exception,they have either destroyed the money,or they are in the,process of destroying it.,So don't think that a,politician or Central Bank,is in the position that,you can always trust him.,It's just another individual,,just another human,,and they always make,mistakes and it's inevitable.,But ideologically, I also believe,that I should have the,right to decide for myself,whether I want to lend you money,,whether I want to borrow money,,it's not up to some politician,or some other institution,to tell me what I can and what I can't do.,That's my business.,- There exists,a definite two-camp divide,over whether Bitcoin should,be used to facilitate liberty,and self-sovereignty or,if it should be regulated,to protect users.,Can you give me an example of,some of these crazy schemes,that people are coming,up with using crypto?,- There's so many.,I remember, but most of them,coming from South Africa.,So in the very beginning, I,remember they used to call me,and try to recruit me.,They say like, ""You've,got a network of people,""you can make a lot of money."",I'm like, ""I would rather be poor,""than to join something,that at the end of the day,I'll hurt my own people."",There's always a joining thing.,It's like a pyramid scheme.,The lady came to our office.,She was really heartbroken,because she has put a lot,of money into a scheme,and then it disappeared.,People actually put,their children's school fees.,What I know is once you start,having an influx of people,calling and saying they want Bitcoin,,know that there's a scheme coming up.,So they're good in a sense,maybe they make Bitcoin,to be used a lot.,But at the same time, they're really bad.,The bad surpasses the good.,One of the biggest challenges,to explaining Bitcoin,is to somebody who comes,already with the 'preknowledge',of what Bitcoin is and then,they come to you and say like,,""How much do I join?,""How would I make money very quick?"",You try to convince the person,that it's not about joining,,it's like a revolution.,It's like a new technology,arising altogether.,It's about you understanding.,They're like, ""No, but it's not that."",The pros for me, is liberation, freedom,,the ability to control your own money,or the ability to send any,amount of crypto or carry it.,Imagine if you were to,carry a chunk of gold,,you want to pass through the,border or whatever, you can't.,So that's the beauty of Bitcoin.,The negativity is people using it wrongly,,making our people poor.,Also, lack of regulations and stuff.,If you can have maybe some,sort of regulatory framework,,it will also help protect us.,I know you cannot control it,because of the way it was created,,but just regulations, it,can help a little bit.,- Since Bitcoin's early days,it's been shrouded in,mystery and controversy,,from the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox,,one of the early exchanges,,to the infamy caused by the,dark web Silk Road marketplace,that accepted Bitcoin for,nefarious goods and services.,While Silk Road became one,of the first use cases for Bitcoin,,it also perhaps put,the mainstream adoption,of cryptocurrencies years behind,where it might have been otherwise.,- It was run by Dread Pirate,Roberts, or Ross Ulbricht.,If you follow the news you,know that Ross Ulbricht,was found guilty by a jury.,The federal judge took his,activities very serious,and she actually sentenced,him to serve a life sentence.,They counted at least six individuals,who had purchased,narcotics off of Silk Road,and died as a result.,What we basically are focused on,,one, is criminal offenses,involving digital currency,,which could be any sort of,crime, whether it's narcotics,,whether it's murder-for-hire,,whether it's identity theft and so on,,in which the bad guys,are utilizing Bitcoin,rather than other forms of money,because they, in our experience,,believe it to be untraceable,,which is clearly an,accident on their part,,a misunderstanding to say,the least.,But we also deal with the,regulation of exchanges of money.,- Very nice.,- Don't touch, don't touch.,- No, you must be careful.,Every single transaction that,occurs in the Bitcoin network,is recorded in something,called the blockchain,,a public ledger of every,transaction that's made.,The only problem is that,even though you can see,every single transaction,,and you can see the addresses,,which are like the account,numbers of the people,that are holding those bitcoins,,you don't actually know who,those addresses belong to.,So, the correct term isn't,anonymous, it's pseudonymous.,Cash is truly anonymous.,If you have a suitcase of,cash and you go and spend it,,there's no way that that,transaction is recorded.,So, Bitcoin is less anonymous than cash,and we certainly know how cash can be used,for nefarious purposes.,We know that suitcases of money,and drug deals happen all the time.,- There was a,name that kept coming up,in conversation and research,,and for his name alone it,felt necessary to meet him.,Fluffy Pony.,It's a nickname that stuck years ago,that despite his best efforts,,Riccardo is not able to get rid of,,but amongst the noise of the crypto world,,Fluffy Pony definitely stands out.,Why is privacy so important,and how is it lacking in the,way we currently do things?,- Privacy is the natural state of things.,You're not closing the,door at the bathroom,because you want to plot to,overthrow the government.,You're closing the door at the bathroom,because you don't want,people to see you on the loo.,There's certain aspects of our,life we wanna keep private,,that we might reveal to certain people.,We hopefully take our clothes off,in front of the person we're married to,,but we don't go and walk around,the shopping center naked.,But privacy has become, it's,sort of become, overshadowed,by oh bad people want privacy,,or things like if you,have nothing to hide,,then why do you care about privacy?,It's not about wanting,to hide it from everyone.,It's just that we wanna control,who sees the information.,If law enforcement or the government,want information about me,,they should have to come knock on my door,to get that information.,They shouldn't be able to,just get that information,because my bank is telling them,about every transaction I've ever done.,- I know people say there is,information on the internet,,but it's different.,If I'm able to really,expand on the information,maybe you picked from the internet,and make you understand,,it makes me feel good,because I know I've empowered you,,you will take the same knowledge,and you give it to someone.,So if I'm able to reproduce,someone who does what I do.,That's the real deal,,that's the real deal, yeah.,Had it not been for him,,I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.,He made me to know about Bitcoin.,So because I was trying to,help him during that time,,now I'm helping people with knowledge.,So it's like transferring,whatever I wanted to do for him,now he's somehow doing it,for the people through me.,I'll continue to honor him, yeah.,He'll be my baby forever.,Yep, yeah.,- When I got introduced to,Bitcoin, it's like okay,,let me save, each month,I save, I save, I save.,I think more about the future,,what's gonna happen in the future,and I orientate my actions,today that'll impact the future.,I mean, that's the reason,why I'm studying, right?,I'm like, it seems like some,really interesting stuff,in the space of crypto.,I'm not saying I'm against banking,,I'm just against,fractional reserve banking.,So, I orientate my actions towards that,,the new financial system.,I would be a lot more stressed,if I didn't have Bitcoin, honestly.,- Why?,- Let's say, for example,,if we have the Central Bank,government decides like,yo, I'm gonna print like two trillion rand,into the economy.,The consequences of that,would be hyperinflation.,I can't remember who said,this, but it says like,,""Bitcoin's not about getting,your money out of the country,,""it's about getting your,country out of your money."",Essentially, it's like,protecting your savings,,protecting your stored value,,that's why I'm into Bitcoin.,- I think the financial,crisis started a discussion,that Bitcoin then accelerated,around why the financial,system works the way it does,and whether or not it,should work that way.,How can we make it more transparent?,How can we make it more fair?,How can we improve the world,of money for everybody?,But it was a very difficult discussion,to have with people in,the early days of Bitcoin.,I was writing for Finweek,Magazine at the time,and I did a story on Bitcoin in 2011,,and some of my colleagues,literally laughed at me.,They were like, ""This is the dumbest thing,""we've ever heard of, it's a bubble,,""it'll never be worth more than $9."",At its height it was worth $20,000,and it's gonna be worth a,lot more than that one day,,and every time we see this cycle.,We have people laughing,,it's not gonna last,,it's over-inflated,,and every time they're right,for a very short period of time,,and then every time they're proven,ultimately wrong in the medium-term.,I believe that one day,it's something that you,won't have to understand.,It just makes your life better.,Very few people can tell you,exactly how their smartphone works.,It doesn't matter because the narrative,has become about why it's good for them.,What does it enable in their lives?,Well I can speak to my grandchildren.,I can stay up-to-date with the news.,I can take pictures of my family.,Those are the things that matter.,How the processor works,and all of the software,that makes it possible,,nobody really needs to,understand the bits and pieces.,- Welcome to Emaweni, in,the middle of the night.,- At two,o'clock in the morning,,I followed Lorien out to Soweto,to witness history being made,with a live demonstration of,his Bitcoin prepaid meter.,Lorien would be Skyping,through to a conference,on the other side of the,world at MIT in Boston,,where his friend Ed would,be making a Bitcoin payment,straight to the meter.,- So, what I'm gonna do,is I'm actually going to -,be ready, okay, so let's get,this whole thing started.,They're gonna be calling right now,,in about two minutes,and then I'm gonna come to that classroom.,- Okay.,- Shame, they've been here,for two hours, three hours.,They got here at 12.,Hi, Ed.,- This is a pack room here.,- Hi, everybody.,- Can you see all of them?,- Hi, nice to see you,all, thanks for coming.,- Could you shortly,explain where you are,and what you're doing there?,- Sure, I'm in a city outside,of Johannesburg, in South Africa,,it's called Soweto.,Where I am right now is very close,to where Nelson Mandela,used to live in his youth,,and I'm in a small school.,We're gonna be demonstrating,our blockchain prepaid metering system.,So, this is now one of,the electrical boxes.,I don't think you can actually see,,but there is a ,,this is now just a conventional meter box,,but there's a blockchain,enabled meter over there,,and what we're gonna do now is,I'm gonna go to the classroom,and there's some teachers,there, and it's all dark,,and Ed's gonna now make the transaction.,- How long,does the transaction take?,- The transaction takes about,,it should take about 30 seconds.,All right.,Go for it.,Okay, and now we wait I guess.,And we hope it works.,So yeah, now what's happening,is it's now going through the blockchain,,the meter's gonna detect the payment,,it's gonna calculate the tariff,,and then load the required,amount of electricity,onto the meter.,So, there's nothing on it at the moment.,That's why we're in the dark.,And, hopefully in a few seconds,the meter should be activated.,I'm actually sitting in,one of the classrooms here,,so you can see,the staff here, ready?,This should be a few, about 30 seconds.,- 41 seconds.,- 41 seconds, okay.,All right.,- Maybe you should,just switch them on.,- No, no, not fair if there's switching.,This is usually what,happens in the live demo.,- Yeah.,Let me just check if I,have the right address.,Yeah, yeah it's Emaweni.,- Hmm, oh there we go.,I've got four sons who are busy.,One of the things that,I've been involved with,is the Cub Scouts.,I take my sons there on a Friday night.,We get involved teaching,kids how to be independent,,and also, most importantly,,be good citizens.,It's very important to get children,to consider their,communities and their society,and to be empathetic to other people,,to try and make their communities better,,to build it up, to try,and think civic-mindedly.,- This is the,thing that I struggle with.,So in Africa, I don't know that it helps,to resolve third world problems,because if you live in a hut,you don't have access to the internet.,You don't have access to a phone.,Do you think that it's actually something,that could really,genuinely make a practical,,real-world, difference here?,- I tend to think that,cryptocurrencies have potential,to solve real world,problems all over the world.,You're not gonna solve all,the problems, certainly.,Even if it just becomes a,global reserve currency,,the local currency for a,country becomes less important,,where people can trivially,shift from whatever,the local currency is into Bitcoin,,and then it doesn't matter,what happens to the local currency.,Now, your reliance isn't on the government,to keep the economy stable,because you've got a back-up,,you've got a fallback.,That's very powerful and I think that,that's something that,could have lasting effects,and impact in Africa.,We've had this leapfrog thing that occurs,,where there's an innovation,,like digital cellphones,when they came out,,those were the first cellphones,that really got deployed in South Africa,,and because of that we were on 3G faster,than the United States and most of Europe,,and it's just because the infrastructure,is a little bit more modern,,because it was deployed,slightly later in the game.,There are a class of problems in Africa,where we can just leapfrog,,and use cryptocurrencies,to our advantage, and I think,that's what's gonna happen.,- Even though, myself,on a day-to-day basis,,I don't use Bitcoin in,the way I would like.,I do wanna be able to spend Bitcoin,and I do wanna be able,to have people out there,in this country spending Bitcoin.,I want merchants and service,providers to accept Bitcoin.,So, instead of waiting,for them to do that,,I'm now going and actually,providing those tools.,I will certainly strive,to create the opportunity,for people to spend it,in their day-to-day lives,and also to accept it in,their day-to-day lives.,- Ironically,,the story I expected,was to be told by a bunch of men in suits,just in pursuit of more money.,I expected to find,bandits, and terrorists,,and everyday-Joes organizing,dark deeds in dark places.,But in the last five and a half years,,the story I thought I would be telling,about the crypto space in,Africa never materialized.,I've realized that my,pessimism at the beginning,of this journey was,actually just misplaced,,but regardless, that pessimism,has now turned to optimism,,not so much because of the,tech, but because of the people,who are using it to make the,circle both bigger and better,,and that's what I call the,beginning of a revolution.,- Just off the top of my head.,- Bitcoin.,- Ethereum Classic.,- Huntercoin.,- Monero.,- Ethereum.,- Ripple XRP.,- Bitcoins.,- Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Silver,,Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Private,,all of the things that start with Bitcoin,and have another word after it.,- Dash, Zcash.,- There's Cardano.,- EOS.,- Stellar Lumens.,- Calibur.,- IOTA.,- There's another one called E-Ora.,- Bitconnect.,I'm sorry, I'm sorry,,that was like a scam coin.,- Did I say Dash?,Of course Dash, Litecoin Cash.,- I just hit a blank.,- Now they're escaping me, these coins.,As many as I can.,- There's so many, it's,hard to think of them.,- UBU.,BNB.,PRIVEX.,This should be a lot easier.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Banking_on_Africa_The_Bitcoin_Revolution-12363788
Breaking the Chain (2020) - full transcript,"It's a fate worse than death for countless animals: a life sentence of isolation and deprivation. Their only hope is PETA's Community Animal Project, a field team fighting against a national epidemic of animal overpopulation and neglect.","It’s upsetting,when people say things,and they don’t understand,what we do.,They’ve never come to visit,,or they’ve never,posed any questions.,They look at numbers,on a piece of paper,,and they make assumptions.,I think it’s very,important for people,to look behind the numbers,,at the individual animals,that we encounter,in the field,and what their stories are.,Every one of those,numbers is a story.,
,
,
,Every one of those numbers,is an individual animal.,It’s OK.,I know you like this.,I know. I know.,I know, sweetheart.,Just give me a second.,- You all right?,- Yeah.,- That was an enthusiastic grab.,- Yeah.,That was an enthusiastic grab.,Glad you like it, though.,I’m gonna look at you.,I’m gonna look at you.,Come here.,Come on.

,sorts of areas we visit,and the predicament,of the dogs that we help,,it’s a fairly typical day.,She has lost quite,a bit of weight,since I was here in June.,And her hair loss,is more severe,,and you can see,she’s very hungry.,And I can see the fleas,crawling all over her body.,And the flies are eating,her ears up alive.,I don’t know that she's,fed on a regular basis.,This is her life every day.,Every second of every minute,of every hour of every day,,this dog lives here.,The woman across the,street is the sister,of the man who owns this dog.,And I think it’s,very important for us to try,and get her out of here,very, very soon.,PETA moved to Norfolk in 1996.,It was a fiscal decision.,Cost of living here was low.,We have a building here,on the Elizabeth River,,downtown Norfolk,,and a dog park,,which is more than an acre.,We actually have two dog parks,,a big one and a small one.,We’ve been growing,by leaps and bounds,,and so this building,allowed us to,have a shelter,on the fourth floor.,CAP stands for the,“Community Animal Project.”,It is a division of PETA’s,Cruelty Investigations,Department,that was born out of necessity,after PETA moved down to,southeastern Virginia,in the mid-’90s.,Bye!,Over the months,and years after we arrived,,calls from the,community for help,increased from week to week.,And it didn’t take us,very long at the time,to realize that there was a,dire need in the community,,not just our immediate community,here in Norfolk,and Hampton Roads,but far beyond that,into counties that are rural,,impoverished,and even over the border,in northeastern North Carolina,,where there are,entire jurisdictions,where there are,no services at all.,One county we work in doesn’t,even have a veterinarian in it,,let alone a low-cost,spay/neuter program.,When I was an,animal control officer,,I saw the problems,that were out there,and had a friend,that worked at PETA,,and it seemed like a job,where you could actually,get out there,and get your hands dirty,and make a difference.,After my internship here,,I was inspired by the,work that CAP does.,So I decided to stay,and continue to work in CAP.,I started volunteering,in the winter,to do the straw delivery.,And I kind of fell,in love with seeing,the impact of what you do,immediately for the animals.,And I like being out in the,field, getting dirty.,Sitting at a desk,isn’t my thing.,As long,as I can remember,,I’ve always known about PETA,and I’ve always had a,desire to work at PETA.,I was living in Chicago,,and there was a very disturbing,pet store called Animal Jungle.,It was just one of those places,that’s a pure nightmare,for animals.,And I called PETA,to see what I could do.,I ended up speaking,with a caseworker,and sort of followed the,steps that she gave me to do,,went back in there,with a video camera,,sent some information.,But when I would,call after hours,to give the caseworker updates,,one time I heard that it said,,“For job opportunities,,press 7.”,So I pressed 7.,And that’s that.,A typical day is usually,going out to North Carolina,,where we help out people,with their dogs,that need assistance,that don’t have money,to take care of their dogs.,The people are really poor,,and usually the dogs,are chained out,,and people forget,about their dogs.,We always have,to be given permission,to be on somebody’s property.,So we’ll go and knock.,Hey! My name’s Jes.,I’m from PETA.,We had stopped,by before about Brownie.,Mm-hmm.,We had tried to catch,you a couple of times,,but maybe you weren’t home.,Oh, OK.,Well, we just stopped by,because when I was,here last time,,it was in February,and he was kind of thin,,so I was just checking,to see if things were,,how things were going.,He does? He’s doing good?,Yeah.,I know we had also talked,about maybe moving him,to some shade.,Today it’s a little mild,,but you know,,the other day was like 90,degrees and without shade.,Did I wake you up?,You have a headache?,Aww, I’m sorry.,Well, I can see that he doesn’t,really want me messing with him,,but I’m gonna give,him a couple treats.,OK.,Will you just make,sure that he has,plenty of water out here?,OK, where?,Oh, in the jugs? OK.,Tethering is tying up your dog,or other animals 24 hours a day,,365 days a year no matter,what the weather is,no matter, you know,,whether they have shelter.,It could be pouring,rain or snow.,It could be freezing cold to the,point where their water bowl,becomes a frozen piece of ice,and is therefore not drinkable.,Ice storms and hurricanes,are very common,in this area,as are thunderstorms.,And in the summer months,,temperatures here can exceed,100 degrees Fahrenheit.,Some people will tether or chain,their animals with, you know,,an old refrigerator for cover,or a wire crate for shelter,,which, of course,,doesn’t do anything.,Or just inadequate shelter like,a plastic doghouse,that comes apart,,or the dogs are very bored,,so they chew at them,,and eventually the doghouses,don’t serve a purpose at all.,Dogs are social creatures,,and they want to be,inside with their families.,And unfortunately, the dogs we,see most chained are pit bulls.,Where we go,,dogfighting is a thing,,so we see dogs that are stolen,,used as bait.,People let their dogs,run at large as well,,so we see dogs,that are on chains,attacked by dogs,that are running at large.,And because their,guardians may not,go out and check,on them every day,,they can be left to suffer,for days with wounds.,And after a certain point,,those dogs aren’t always,in a position that they,can be adopted back out.,When we was growin’,up, we had a dog like a poodle.,A poodle was left in the house.,And when we got other dogs like,collies and stuff like that,,pit bull or German shepherd,,they were put outside.,- All dogs are house dogs.,- Hmm?,All dogs are house dogs.,What, what makes a dog,not a house dog?,Yeah?,I mean, so you—,I know you’re supposed to keep,them in there when it’s hot.,You’re supposed to keep,them in there all the time.,I mean dogs are pack animals.,Keeping ’em chained outside,,it breaks down their,mental health.,It’s not good for them.,OK.,Like I said, the way that, like,,these dogs are set up,,I mean, it isolates them.,When they’re inside and they're,with their pack,,- they’re happier.,- Mmm.,I’ve asked people,why they have dogs,when they keep,’em a certain way.,I think in many of the,cases that we deal with,,it’s a very deeply ingrained,traditional way in which people,were raised,that dogs belong outside or,it’s a possession,that allows you to say,,“Well, I have 20 pit bulls,,and I breed my pit bulls.”,I’ve heard,,“They’re out there,to let me know,when someone comes,into my yard.”,So they’re pretty much,little alarm systems.,Sometimes the people,with bigger dogs, you know,,they don’t want their dog,to ruin their furniture or,they didn’t want,to put up with a puppy,peeing on the carpet,and things like that.,They don’t wanna,have the patience,to go through potty training.,I grew up in a rural,part of Virginia where,most normal kids were,riding their bikes,,and then I was just,out there with a pack of dogs.,And always going,to their houses and,just offering to do,something with them,because a lot of people,kept them chained.,One of the struggles,that we really face,is just general lack,of education and knowing,what they really need.,So we try to educate,people as much as possible,,but it’s hard to take,someone coming in who,is telling you everything,you’ve been doing is wrong,,and you need to start,doing it this way.,Is she in heat?,Yeah, it looks,like she’s in heat.,Do you put her,inside when she’s in heat?,Uh,’Cause otherwise,,if she’s not pregnant now,,she will be very soon.,That’s that the song,“my milkshake brings all,the boys to the yard.”,The communities that we go to,,they’re all very poor.,Most of the people are,really low-income.,I think it’s important,to remember that,you have to have compassion,for them, for their situation,,for the reason,that they’re there.,Because they don’t wanna,be in that situation, either,,and they were taught from their,family to be this way,,to treat animals that way.,So, you know, all we can,really do is go out there,and help their animals,the best that we can.,All righty,,it’s good to meet you all.,Each day,,the fieldworkers are,assigned certain cases.,It may be that they also,remember cases from the area,or they’ve asked to go,back to a certain case.,And then they go,out in the field,,usually on their own.,Sometimes two,fieldworkers go together.,Could be that they are,delivering doghouses,,it could be that they are taking,an animal back home after spay.,It could be that they’re picking,up an animal to be spayed.,It could be that they are going,out because somebody called us,because their dog fell,,you know, off the balcony,and needs to be looked at.,It could be a frequent flyer,,if you will,,where we go out once a,month and give flea prevention.,You know, we bring out dog food.,We bring out tie-outs,to people that have dogs,in backyards and won’t,bring them in their house.,The flies bite their ears,’cause the owners never,clean up the feces,,so the flies will actually,eat their ears off.,Like, I’ve seen,ears that are gone.,We do a lot of education,in terms of teaching people,we need to get a little,bit of vet help here,or alternately this is,how you trim nails.,This is better nutrition,or just kind,of trying to improve,the lives of the animals,that we meet.,You can see where,the quick is right there.,Right, right.,If you go further than that,,she’s gonna bleed.,Oh, yeah.,I mean, we’ll come,out and do it for free,,but just we need to get,on it more often,,because the more,that they grow,,then the quick,will keep going out.,And as they keep getting longer,,it’s harder to get them,where they need to be.,You know what I’m saying?,Oh, man. She loves you,,doesn’t she?,You want a,couple cans of dog food?,And I'll get the,fleameds. OK. Be back in a sec.,We’ll stop back out in,,you know, like, you know,,six weeks and check,back in and do the nails again,,see how she’s doin’.,Yeah.,Oh, yeah, I can give you—I can,give you a card. No problem.,Well, like I said,,we appreciate it, man.,Well, I’m glad we,could help you out.,The first time I came here,,she didn’t come,out of the doghouse at all.,It’s taken several visits,,you know.,Mm-hmm.,Last time I tried to pet her,,she flinched.,You know, she’s not,used to being touched.,You see?,She doesn’t know what it is.,She doesn’t...,she’s not familiar with petting.,She’s not... she's just afraid.,It’s always, you know,,the loneliness, the fear,,struggling with the flies,,with the mosquitos,,with the fleas, with the ticks.,And being chained,,some of these dogs that we saw,,in full sun in this weather,,it’s absolutely horrific.,Nobody would stop,by Zena’s house,by happenstance,and stumble upon the dog who’s,so sorely neglected that she’s,not long for this world.,The bottom line is that it’s,about what these animals need,,and most of these animals have,never had someone hold them,and kiss them and tell them,that they’re wonderful,and give them a good,meal and a clean,,soft blanket to lie on.,For most of the animals,we deal with,,that’s the first time they've,ever had a kind word.,You can see that all over Zena’s,face when we deal with her.,That no one has ever bent down,and told her she was beautiful,or she was a good girl.,No one has ever bothered,to treat her for fleas,that she has by the thousands.,No one has,bothered to take her for a walk,so she could roll in the grass.,Nobody’s bothered to give her,a meal that she appreciates.,She’s basically been kept alive,with food, water,,and a doghouse we gave her.,Oh, OK.,OK, thank you so much.,Thank you.,You are so welcome.,That dog was living,in fear of everything,,so I hope we can,do something special,and give her a chance to enjoy,life and find happiness.,It’ll take a little while,,but perhaps she’ll be,able to be rehabilitated.,We’re not taking the,flies with us, Zena.,We’re gonna leave,the flies here.,Beautiful dog. Beautiful girl.,When the animal is surrendered,,the form is signed by the owner.,We bring the animal back.,We take the animal upstairs.,They get, like,,a really nice guest room.,We give them food and treats,,and they even get music.,It’s a nice stay.,My job at the,PETA animal shelter,is to help take in animals,and provide their evaluation,and make sure they’re,comfortable for the stay,,whether or not it’s,overnight or for several days,,and see them,through to their next step.,By far of any,shelter I’ve worked in,,the rooms are really nice.,We lay down the floors,with thick blankets,and put toys in there,,food and water obviously.,Usually,,we’ll play some classical,,relaxing music for them.,One of the rooms is,bigger than my first,apartment bedroom and bathroom,combined.,Most of the animals,that we have come in,we try to transfer out quickly,to some of our,placement partners,that do have,traditional shelters,,and we also use foster,homes as part of our shelter.,We are a shelter,under Virginia law,,and even though the number,of animals that we helped,through the shelter last year,was roughly 2,000 animals,,the number of animals’,lives that we touched,through the local,program was more than,20,000 animals—to give,you an idea of how,the sheltering part of our,work is vital to those animals.,But so is everything,else that we’re doing.,When we bring all,animals into the shelter,either for a surrender,or for spay or for neuter,,we do a health assessment,form on all the animals.,We check from head,to toe—you know,,their ears, their mouth,,their teeth.,Are there any sores or any cuts,or anything like that on them,that is notable?,Are they eating?,Did they go potty?,PETA takes in all animals.,We have had mice.,We’ve had pigs, ducks,,of course, your dogs,and your cats, iguanas, rats.,So all animals.,This chain came off of a puppy,whose neck vertebrae can’t,hold the weight of it,but also makes it,so that the puppy usually gets,tangled or lethargic,,where they’re not able to move.,They can’t get,to food and water.,Most of the dogs,that we see, when we find them,,they’re trapped at the end,of a heavy chain.,Sometimes, the chain,is heavy on purpose,because someone is trying,to build their neck muscles.,You know, the people who,do that think that it looks,quote unquote “tough.”,And so essentially,,tethering is chaining.,It’s just staking out an,animal as if they were,,you know, an old bicycle.,Tethering is something that we,work very hard to outlaw.,We’ve been able to get tethering,banned or restricted in every,single city in the Hampton Roads,area here in Virginia,,and we’re also working,in North Carolina,to make it so that,you can’t leave your,dog tethered or chained,24 hours a day.,At the moment,,it’s totally legal to do that,in most of the North Carolina,jurisdictions that we visit.,We have been able to get it,restricted and/or,banned in some jurisdictions,,and so we’re kinda trying,to have a ripple effect,with that.,Some areas do have,chaining ordinances where,you can’t have your,dog chained out at all.,In other places, you can have,your dog chained out for,,like, three hours a day, which,is kind of frustrating because,there’s no animal,control officer that’s,gonna sit there for three hours.,They’ll come back, and the,dog is inside or chained out.,They can’t really,enforce the law.,The other thing we found,is that the people,who live in a place,where there is an,anti-tethering ordinance,,they’ll sometimes,put them in pens,,and the pens will be just,as small as their tether.,So there needs to be,stricter enforcement,of how big a pen can be.,So that it doesn’t become the,same as chaining a dog up.,Hey! Are you David?,Oh, hi! I met your,brother Dennis yesterday.,So we brought,out a plastic house for—,do you call him,Jack or Jake?,Anything. OK. OK.,Um, so yeah, I set up a,plastic house for him,because that metal,thing was off.,Um, did you guys talk about,do you think you wanna,get him neutered?,OK.,Nooo.,Nooo!,I know, but I talked,to Dennis yesterday.,Pit bulls do not,have it easy out here.,Well, I know. That’s what,everybody says, though, and,I mean, half these dogs,end up being fought.,You never know about the people,that you’re gonna,give the puppies to.,And especially for him,with being, like, a male dog,,he’s gonna get older,and the longer he’s chained,being unneutered, the more,frustrated he’s gonna get.,So yeah, if you guys,decide to neuter him,,we’ll be happy to do it.,We might be able to bring,out one of the wooden doghouses.,He’s so big,,I have a feeling he’s gonna,break that two-tone in half in,,like, five minutes.,PETA employs carpenters,through our,Operations Department,that build these doghouses,that come in different sizes.,We do try to not,give doghouses,unless the animal has,been spayed or neutered,,so that’s a real,bargaining chip for us,,as a foot in the door.,The doghouse program,is a phenomenal program,for the dogs who,get the doghouses.,Many of them have,never had shelter.,For many of them,,that’s as close as they’re,going to get to a home.,It’s very sad to say.,I mean, a doghouse is,not the end-all solution,,but it makes a,tremendous difference,in the winter especially,but also in the summer,if the dogs don’t have shade.,Our doghouses,have an overhang.,The opening is off to the side.,They have a flap.,They’re just big enough,for the dog to go in,so that in the winter the,body heat is contained inside.,They have a little,hook in the back,so that we can put the,water bucket onto it.,And they also have our,800-number on the side,,so heaven forbid,,if an animal is sick,or an animal is dying or an,animal gets hit by a car,,the person who has that animal,doesn’t have an,excuse not to call us,,because that phone number is,right there on the,side of the house.,We deliver probably,about 300 doghouses every year,and it helps make dogs’,life a little bit less hellish,,especially in the wintertime.,It’s like a last resort.,Like, I try to talk people into,getting their dogs,in the house.,And if that can’t happen,,then the doghouse is obviously,the best resort for that.,We’ll set it up for you even if,it’s in, like, a pen or a fence.,We’ll flip it over the,fence for somebody.,I can’t tell you,how many cases we have,discovered by virtue of offering,this doghouse program,,because people will hear,about it and they will call.,Or they’ll ask their cousin,,“Where did you get,your doghouse?”,“Oh, it was free—I,got it from PETA.”,And then they call,us for a doghouse,,and we’re able,to ask them questions,,go and visit with the dogs,,assess the situation,,talk to them about spay/neuter,,talk to them about flystrike,,talk to them,about heartworm disease,,talk to them about just,basic necessities of life,that the dog needs if there’s no,water or there’s no water bowl.,So the doghouses are, for PETA,,they’re very expensive,,but they make a,tremendous difference,,a world of difference,for the recipients.,PETA has a,straw-delivery program,,and every winter we deliver,straw to needy “backyard dogs.”,We have a pallet in our,parking lot with bags of straw.,People can come and take,free straw, and they do.,We also have our staff,volunteer on the weekends,to go out into given areas,where we know there is a,high concentration of chained,dogs and offer free straw.,The straw in the winter,,it’s bedding for dogs.,People thoughtlessly give,them things like a blanket.,Well, if it rains,and then it’s 32 degrees,,you know, the blanket is,basically a giant piece of ice.,So that’s not very helpful.,But the straw will remain dry.,The dogs love it.,They love to roll in it.,When we put it down,,they get very excited.,And it does help contain their,body heat in the doghouses.,We wish we didn’t,have to give straw away,because we don’t want,dogs to be outside,,but the reality is that a,lot of dogs do live outside,and the straw makes a,big difference for them.,That’s your spot now?,She’s, like, “I like this.”,Here, do you want,that one in there? Yeah?,Aww.,The thing is,,is that if your dogs are outside,and they’re not,getting treatment for it,,they’re gonna,get heartworms.,It’s a parasite,that wraps around the heart.,They will {end-italic} get it in our area.,Yeah. I think so.,I’ll check, but I think so,,’cause I think he was at the,end stages of heartworm.,Hi, Whitey.,Is he, he’s friendly?,Yeah, he’s friendly.,Hey, bud.,You look very friendly.,Hi. Hi. Hi.,What up, bud?,I’m not gonna give you,another dog to tie out here.,So we only adopt to inside.,You know, it’s just when they,live inside, they’re happier.,So when they’re tied outside,,that’s not the life,that we encourage.,Exactly why what,happened to Brownie.,They get diseases,,and things happen to ’em.,Everybody here has,been neutered already.,Yeah.,Wonderful, that’s great. OK,,I’m gonna unload the doghouses.,Do you have a spot, though,,that we could maybe move him,where he’d have a,little bit more shade?,Yeah, let’s...,I think that would be great.,He’s just having some good fun.,Whoa, he’s gonna,take you out there.,Hi, bud.,Hi.,Hi.,Good.,You just have to wash,them out every so often.,Here you go.,I meet thousands,of cats and dogs.,So obviously, I have connections,with all or most of them.,All right, see you later.,It’s definitely hard,to leave them,after visiting the,animals in the field.,But as much as it’s,hard to leave,,I know there’s,someone else out there,waiting for us to get there.,I met Edith,when she was just a year old.,She was one of the,“backyard dogs”,that we checked on regularly.,She was chained,at an address that had,several pit bulls chained,on the property with her.,We tried for years,to get her surrendered,,and we educated her owners.,We provided a doghouse.,We spayed her.,You know, every time,that I was in the area,,I would go,and visit Edith and,try to talk her owner,into giving her to me.,At one point, she was no,longer on the property,,and I assumed that she had died,because that’s what happens,to dogs who are chained outside,,either from the heat—she’s,a black chow mix,,so it’s harder for them,than other dogs.,I mean, of course, I was,,yeah, I mean, I was,devastated when we lost her.,You meet these guys,,and they’re your friends,,and you tell them all the time,,you know,,“I will be back for you.”,You know, we’re trying,as hard as we can to get them.,We didn’t know,where Edith had went.,She must have been,around seven or eight years old.,We don’t visit a lot of dogs,that get to be that age.,“Backyard dogs” just do,not have a long life span.,You know, her being older,,generally being,neglected for so long,,I assumed that she was dead.,Four years,we’ve been visiting this dog,,for four years.,He called us to get a doghouse.,This dog has had,several litters of puppies,until he let us spay her.,I don’t even remember,where I was, you know,,four years ago, you know,,what was going on in my life.,Every day is a different day,,you know,,and exciting things happen,,and I travel,,and I enjoy myself,sometimes.,And you know, this dog has,had the same patch of dirt,,the same doghouse,,the same flies, the same fleas,,mosquitos.,Nothing to give her joy.,There is nothing.,She has been maintained,in order to survive physically,,and emotionally she,was just broken.,I mean,,she was so poorly socialized.,She never went for walks.,Where she had to eat is where,she had to urinate and defecate,,and that’s where she,also had to sleep.,And that was her life every day,,every day.,And I think,about this dog a lot.,I thought about this,dog a lot because,when it’s storming—last night,,there was a storm.,And my dogs,,my dogs at home were terrified.,I had to stay up with my dogs,,who are inside,and have security.,This dog doesn’t have anybody,to tell her that it’s OK,and the storm will pass,and to hug her and just make,her feel a little bit better.,She’s alone, and all she's got,is that doghouse we gave her,and our visits.,So it’s a wonderful day,that she’s out of this,life sentence she was,serving for no reason at all.,What?,You wanna throw it?,- I wanna throw it.,- OK.,I wanna throw it.,Let’s, let's let her play,with it for one second.,- More cats.,- Cats.,- It’s quite small.,- You see all the...,It’s not really healthy.,Aww, yeah, yeah.,You see all the,infection in his eyes?,In the eyes. I saw.,I know, buddy.,I’m sorry.,She said there are,a lot of wild cats,and they have,babies all the time.,He’s got a couple,of maggots I think on his nose.,The eyes, the eye look...,Yeah, his eyes are sealed shut.,Can we come back there?,No, why don’t you guys,wait because I don’t,,it’s a lot for these,little guys.,Bye, young man.,Thanks for your help.,“Outdoor cats”,that live outside 24/7,,they tend to contract,diseases from each other.,Outdoor or feral cats,that are not vaccinated,,which most of them are not,,they can carry feline,leukemia and feline AIDS,,and they can spread,it to other cats.,They are exposed to the,dangers of Mother Nature.,The “outdoor cats”,that are kept out,typically don’t have,a very long life span.,If they get hurt,,there isn’t much vet care,,so you see a lot of wounds,,a lot of infection.,If a cat does get hit by a car,,it’s really sad because,a lot of times,they won’t check and make sure,the animal has even passed.,And so they can languish,on for days and days.,“Outdoor cats”—I mean,,they’re more prone to injuries.,We see where they’ve been,attacked by other animals,,by wildlife.,We’re always telling the,clients who we deal with,to please spay and neuter.,Please keep their,animals inside.,There are so many of them,,and they aren’t,spayed or neutered.,One unspayed cat can produce,over 200 cats in one,year just from them,,you know, mating and having,litters upon litters of kittens.,You might get a call for,,like, five or six cats,,but really, when you show up,,there’s 18 or more.,And cats, they start reproducing,when they’re a lot younger,than dogs and faster.,Because there is such a huge,number of cats out there,,definitely having them,spayed and neutered,will help prevent unwanted,litters and help save cats.,Uh, you have a couple cats,for spay/neuter, right?,Yeah.,OK. How many you have? Two?,Two.,Two. OK. Are they inside?,OK, well, I’ll give you the kit.,Do you need my,help catching ’em,,or are they gonna run,more when they see me?,Don’t let 'em out here.,Yeah. Let’s...,OK. Well, let’s...,is your dog friendly?,Oh, yeah.,OK. All right.,Let’s take 'em in then.,Where’s all this girl's hair?,- Huh?,- Where’s all her hair?,Does she have flea meds on now?,OK, we better put some on her.,Where is your white cat?,She’s pregnant now?,You don’t wanna get her spayed?,OK, you wanna wait ’til after?,OK, how far along is she?,Ay.,You just have the one other cat?,OK.,Well, soon-to-be babies,,right? OK.,Well, where are those babies?,What’s your plan for 'em?,You wanna keep ’em,,or you want us to find,somewhere for them to go?,How many?,You’re—OK,,so you’re gonna have three,,seven cats,,plus the babies on the way?,Well, the thing is if, I mean,,if they’re kittens,,it’s easy enough,to find them homes.,Yeah.,Especially, you’re,gonna have a whole nother,litter of kittens.,Who’s “her”? Your wife?,Yeah.,Where’s she at?,Ah. When’s she get out?,That’s a long time.,How old...,See the kittens are gonna—you,talk to her when you see her.,And the person who brings these,cats tomorrow will ask you.,It’s just if you're,about to have more kittens,,that’s a lot of kittens.,Yep.,Well, there’s a tremendous,overpopulation and homelessness,problem for animals,,and there has been for many,,many years.,It’s still a crisis,,but over the years,,due to spay/neuter efforts,,the number of animals,affected has diminished,but is still astronomical.,So the estimate is that more,than six million animals,go into animal,shelters every year.,And roughly half of those,have to be euthanized,because there is not a good,home out there for them.,So this is a national epidemic.,Every single community has,an overpopulation crisis.,By virtue of affluence and laws,,some communities’ problems may,be less significant than others.,The area where we,happen to be located,,the problem is very pervasive,,and there are studies,that show that,animals in low-income areas,are more likely to reproduce.,And that’s why our,clinics focus so heavily,on low-income areas,and indigent populations,,the elderly poor,,so that animals who,would otherwise,have no services get,services from us.,But the overpopulation,and homelessness problem,remains an epidemic,,and that is the reason why PETA,advocates always adopting,,never buying, banning,breeding of dogs and cats,,mandating spay/neuter,,because there are,animals literally,dying for homes,in animal shelters,because people are still buying,and people are still breeding.,Animal overpopulation happens,because people don’t spay,and neuter their animals.,And, like, for cats,,they just let them roam outside,,reproduce, and keep on roamin’.,He was mad at me for a while.,For the neuter?,It’s better,for him long-term though.,Yeah. I know it is.,But it’s hard,to explain that to him.,We probably shoulda,got rid of mine years ago.,We make it really,easy for people,to spay and neuter their animals,because not only will we,offer the service for free,but we will go to their house,and pick up their animals,,bring them to the clinic,,have them spayed and neutered,,and return them home.,You don’t have to do anything.,You don’t have to go anywhere.,You don’t have to get up.,All you have to do,is sign this form.,Bam, poof, it’s done for you.,Welcome to PETA’s,first-ever 24-hour Spayathon.,We’ve been here,since 5:00 p.m. last night.,We’ve had hundreds,and hundreds and hundreds,of dogs and cats show up.,People are really,taking advantage,of the 25 dollar,24-hour Spayathon,,which is amazing because one,of our vets told me that,at least 60 % of the animals,she’s seeing she can tell,would have not been done,had we not done this special.,We have waves and waves,and waves of activity coming.,We had one at 5:00 p.m.,,one at 9:00 p.m.,,one at 1:00 a.m.,,and one at six in the morning.,And then our 9:00 a.m. check-in.,I have a German shepherd.,She’s gonna be two in April.,She’s 77, 78 pounds,,and if I would have had,to take her to the vet,,it would have been, like,,$200 and something or above,,so it is appreciated.,Lori-Jo, our clinics’ manager,,has been here the whole time.,She hasn’t sat.,She hasn’t taken a break.,We spayed and neutered over 400,animals in that amount of time.,It was something that probably,has never been done before,,but it was a good experience.,In many cases when an animal,is matted,or needs grooming,,we will shave them down.,We trim their nails.,We look at them.,A lot of the animals we,see in the field have issues,that our clinic can help treat.,We just amputated,the leg of a dog who,was thrown off the balcony,by a child to another child,who said she could,catch the dog,,and she didn’t catch the dog.,And the dog’s wrist,just clean broke.,And the vet,recommended amputation.,And our vet amputated,the dog’s leg on our clinic.,So our clinic is a,spay/neuter clinic,,but we’re also able to do some,other limited things that,help the community,and help animals.,Watch. She’ll figure this out.,Yeah.,Give her a,little excitement later.,It’s a picnic.,I cannot decide to play or...,I don’t know what to do first.,All right,,let’s look at this situation.,Oof. Not standing,in a good place there.,Mm-hmm.,He’s so decomposed.,Entomologists can usually,tell the kind, you know,,the age of the,insects and things.,That’s why I wanted,to find this man at home,so that we could ask,him some questions,,and if he doesn’t,want the other dog,,I don’t want her,to suffer the same fate.,The major problem is,people have animals,that they can’t take care of.,They don’t care for them.,They don’t feed them.,They chain their dogs,out like a yard ornament.,Any being being,chained out 24/7,,left to die—I think,that’s the worst thing.,One very unique service,that PETA offers in this area,is that we always have,two people on call.,24 hours a day,,365 days a year,,if an animal needs help,,we’re here.,One of the people on call is a,certified euthanasia technician,because we do get,calls after hours,about actively suffering animals,whose misery needs to be ended,as soon as possible.,That can be an end of life,for a companion animal.,It can be a rabbit or a raccoon,who had been hit by a car.,In December, we got a,pager call at ten o’clock,from a very nice,lady in Suffolk,,which is a couple towns away,,and that woman had called,the police department,,animal control,,and was told to call back,the following day at 11:00 a.m.,And what she was,calling about was a dog,who was confined to a pen,,who was paralyzed probably,by virtue of having very,,very advanced heartworm disease.,And what happens with congestive,heart failure is that,the belly fills with fluid,,and this dog’s belly was,so filled with fluid,and so distended that he didn’t,have the strength to stand,,and it was pouring rain.,I was on call,with another CAP staffer,and we drove out there,around 10 o’clock at night,,and this poor dog was in a pen.,He was trapped in a hole,that I have no doubt he dug,for himself over the summer,when he was trying to stay cool.,Dogs dig holes to sort of be,against the cool earth.,It was pouring rain, so the,hole was filled with water.,And so he had been sitting like,that for probably a day or two,,according to the caller,,and he couldn’t get,to the doghouse.,He couldn’t get to the food.,The food he had was,like little pieces of sponge,because it was all soaking wet.,And he couldn’t do anything,but just sit there and,wait for something.,And the police department,was going to let him wait,,you know, another 14, 15 hours.,And he might not have made it.,And so we went out there,,and we were able to carefully,pick him up out of the hole,,put him on a stretcher,,and drag the stretcher,to our vehicle,,put him in the vehicle,,dry him ’cause he was soaking,,and give him something to eat.,And had to explain to the,guardian in the home,,who was,developmentally disabled,,that the dog was suffering,and needed to be euthanized.,And our emergency pager system,prevented this dog,from suffering,for an extra 15 hours.,We were paged by someone who,had given a dog to somebody else,and then went,to check on that dog,,and the dog was,essentially abandoned,but also had a collar,grown into his neck.,And so two of our,folks went out,,and they were able,to get the dog and,take him to the,emergency vet clinic.,His collar was very,deeply embedded,,and he needed to have,it surgically removed.,And he was just,a sort of a puppy.,I mean,,the collar had been left on him,,and then he was allowed to grow,around the collar essentially.,But his spirit was unbroken.,He was a great dog.,We were able,to get him fostered,,and then he found a home.,And that was really wonderful,to see him go from,the hell that he was in to just,being very, very loved.,The most exciting,part about the job,is seeing the before-and-afters.,When we take an animal in,,they usually come to us.,They’re skinny or emaciated.,They’re scared. They’re hungry.,They don’t know,kindness in people yet,,and over time,,I mean,,even after they’re with us,just a couple of days,,their personality really,starts to come out.,We may have given them a bath,,or they’ve put on a,little bit of weight.,Just knowing how scared and,,you know, maybe unsocial they,were when we first took ’em in,and then seeing them in their,new homes months later where,you wouldn’t even recognize,them from both their,physical appearance,and their personality.,And you know,,they’ve gone from being,chained in someone’s backyard,where they’re just forgotten,to sleeping on a couch,,you know,,and getting Christmas presents,under the tree and just having,their lives totally transformed.,It’s OK.,I know you’re very worried,,but it’s OK.,Come on.,Come on, girl. Good girl.,We tried to get her,owner to let us have her,on every single visit.,You know, we can’t make,people do the right thing,,and the only reason that we got,her in the end is because of her,health issues and because she,was very clearly at that point,practically a cruelty case.,Oh, she’s pooping.,Oh, she is? Oh,,right on the blanket. Oh, well.,Aww, poor baby.,That water went,right through her, didn’t it?,Yeah.,Poor thing.,Well, you know, at least,she did it on the floor.,I’ll just fold it up.,There’s a,serious misconception,with the term “no-kill.”,There are some shelters that,perhaps call,themselves “no-kill.”,I think there are,also shelters that,practice what would be,considered “no-kill” policies,but may not be straight-up,“no-kill” shelters.,The term itself is very,appealing to everyone,,for good reason,,because nobody wants,to have to euthanize animals.,The problem with so-called,“no-kill” policies is that,they cause animals to suffer.,That’s the short answer.,How do they do that?,The animals are out there,,and they need help.,Shelters are under,so much pressure,by usually small,but very vocal people,who are opposed to euthanasia,under any circumstance,and target shelters for having,to practice euthanasia.,So what they do is,they pressure shelters to,change their admission policies,so that animals who would have,to be euthanized under normal,circumstances are turned away.,OK.,The intake rate drops,,and by the intake rate,dropping or changing,,the euthanasia rate also drops.,PETA could only take,in animals who are placeable,,and then our what’s called,a “save rate,” if you will,,would be 100 %.,That would be very easy.,But that would mean that we,would have to turn our back,on all the feral cats,that people perceive,as a nuisance,and put poison out or shoot at.,That we would have to turn our,back on all the aggressive dogs,who have gone mad,from being trapped at the end,of a chain their entire lives.,It would mean we’d have to turn,our back on the destitute people,who bring us animals,in their arms,who are suffering who,need to be euthanized.,Because all of those,things contribute to,what ends up being,our statistics.,Our statistics reflect who we,take in and who we help.,About 17 years ago,,I saved a dog,,a wild dog,,that was on the street.,I took her in and took,care of her best I could.,And old age has,caught up to her,,and I decided it was,the humane thing to do,is to have her euthanized.,I’m glad they’re around.,I really appreciate it.,The problem with “no-kill”,is that it’s just a shell game.,They pick and choose who comes,,who doesn’t come.,People get really frustrated,when their animal,isn’t accepted,into a “no-kill” shelter.,They’re put,out into the streets.,They’re given just,willy-nilly to anybody.,It leaves animals abandoned,,to fend for themselves,very often.,It also is very,dangerous in that it,misleads the,public into believing,that “no-kill” is possible.,In Virginia last year,,there were more than 230,000,animals who went into shelters,,public and private.,That’s the problem.,The problem isn’t how many of,those 230,000 were euthanized.,The problem is that 230,000 were,unwanted or homeless,to begin with.,That’s where the,focus has to be,,and that’s why we have,four spay/neuter clinics.,Spaying and neutering,gets to the root of the problem,of animal homelessness.,There are so many,born every year,and end up in shelters,or no place to go.,So spaying and neutering,prevents those,animals from being,born in the first place.,So when you mislead,the public into thinking,,well, look,,this shelter is “no-kill”,and you compare that shelter’s,rate to PETA’s rate of intake,,adoption, euthanasia,,transfer, what-have-you,,of course, the percentages,are gonna look different.,One shelter only,takes animals that,fly out the door because they’re,puppy-mill rescues,or they’re small purebreds,or they’re kittens or puppies,,and one shelter is taking,in animals who are not adoptable,and is making the difficult,decision to euthanize them.,Well, I think a lot,of people that are against,euthanizing animals,,especially the animals,that we euthanize,,they don’t see what,we do on a daily basis.,They don’t see where,the animals come from.,The animals that we pull out,that do end up being euthanized,,they’re in really bad shape.,The owners have,basically had them chained,out their whole lives.,They’ve been in fights.,They have infections all,over them, bite wounds.,I get emotional, but really,when we euthanize an animal,,it’s for the best for them.,Most of the time, they’re in a,lot of pain or suffering,,or they’re chained,out all the time,and have had the,worst life ever.,So these animals aren’t going,to be going through this,pain and suffering anymore.,We love every,single one of them,,and just having the opportunity,to be with them in their last,moments is an honor.,You know, if you look,at Zena inside and out,,everything about her,showed neglect.,She had lost a bunch of hair.,Her skin was inflamed.,Her teeth were worn,down to the roots.,She was anxiety-ridden. She was,terrified of human beings.,Her insides were chewed,through by parasites.,This is what happens to dogs,who are chronically neglected,when they are,kept outdoors 24/7.,And this is why our program is,so important because it serves,these dogs whose owners are,unkind or neglectful or ignorant,and can’t even tell,when their animals need basic,necessities of life.,I’m thankful,that she got to experience,a little bit of kindness,,even if she didn’t,quite understand it,before she moved on.,Never ever,,ever buy an animal anywhere.,Don’t buy an animal,from a pet store.,Don’t buy an animal,from a breeder.,If you are ready to make that,commitment to an animal,,it’s so easy to adopt these,days. You just go online.,You don’t even have,to go to the shelter,,although we certainly,encourage people to do so.,So never buy—always adopt.,Always spay or neuter. You know,,don’t wait. Don’t delay.,It’s not just the,right thing to do,for all dogs and cats because of,overpopulation and homelessness,,it’s also the best,thing to do for that,particular animal,from a health perspective.,If you see something,,say something.,If there is an animal,at the end of a chain,,if there is an animal in a pen,,if something doesn’t seem right,,you don’t have anything to lose.,Call local authorities,,and if you don’t,get action there,,call us, and we will do,our very best to help.,But never be silent.,Pick up that phone.,Go on the computer.,You can report things,anonymously to almost,every organization.,Don’t think that somebody,else is doing the right thing,,because a lot of people,are afraid to get involved.,PETA’s an animal,rights organization.,We did not move down to the,Norfolk/Hampton Roads area,to do sheltering or fieldwork.,We would be thrilled,if we didn’t have to do it.,We do it by necessity.,We do it because we have to.,And I think,that if people are perplexed,as to why we do what we do,and about why we euthanize,,because I understand, you know,,euthanasia is upsetting.,It’s upsetting,that it has to happen.,The people who criticize us are,not the people that we help.,If you went in the field with,any of the folks on our staff,,the reception we,get in the field,,with few exceptions,,like anything else,,is, you know, hugs and,thank-yous. You know, yesterday,I came home with a bag,of cucumbers,the other day.,You know,,people are appreciative,,and they give us thanks the,best way they know how.,And we are dealing,with people who,struggle to put,food on the table.,Mm-hmm. That’s right.,Beautiful babies.,This is a national issue.,PETA is used by advocates,of “no-kill” because,we’re well known.,But we are always,going to do what’s right,for individual animals,,from our perspective,of assessing the animals,and making decisions for them.,We always make the decision,that is the best decision,we can make for that animal,at that particular moment,,and that’s not an easy,thing to do all the time.,You know,,I try to stay very realistic,about what we can,do at each address,,and part of the work,that we do is living on hope.,You know, we hope we,can get them surrendered.,We hope that we can educate,people to do better for them.,I’ve been doing,this for 15 years.,If I didn’t have hope that,things were gonna get better,,I would be in a deep depression.,Edith was missing,for about three years.,Myself and Emily were,going through pictures,from the straw delivery,over the weekend,,and Emily said to me,,“Hey, come here,”,you know,,“look at this picture.”,And so I got up,,and I went over and looked.,And sure enough, instantly,I knew that it was her.,So I went out to the address,,and it turned out that her,guardian had just moved,I talked to her,about Edith getting older and,,you know, basically,,that it’s just not fair,to her to be chained outside.,I mean,,it was never fair to her,,but at this point,,she’s 10 years old.,You know, every time it,gets hot or it gets cold,,it affects her arthritis.,And she ended up telling,me that I could have her.,She tried to tell me that Edith,didn’t like being inside,,which is absolutely not true.,Edith loves to be snuggled,on the couch or the bed.,Anywhere you are,,she wants to be there.,I instantly knew I,wanted to adopt her.,I had known her for so long,,and she was just,such a wonderful girl.,Every moment, she’s just,more and more perfect.,Edith probably makes me happier,than anything else,in this world.,I mean, you know,,I’ve got kind of a hard job,,and it’s, like, man,,hanging out with her,is the best.,She makes my life,better every day.,Oh, and hopefully I make,her life a lot better as well.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Breaking_the_Chain-12879894

The reaction was universal: her sponsors abandoned her...","How am I ever gonna find peace,being comfortable in my own skin?,The truth is, it's taking everything,I've got as a man to become a woman,because when it comes to,being a man, well--,I was one hell-of-a-guy.,There is no weight, no weight.,Oh, yeah! Press that!,From as far back as I can remember,,I've had two desires.,To be strong and to be a woman.,I just never knew,how I could have both.,Did it!,Some of these are my dad's old,photos when he was a kid.,
,
,
,And I think that's,what this one is.,Yeah. Oh, yeah.,These ones are when,I was once a little baby.,That's the trailer I grew up in.,My very humble beginnings.,Growing up basically,poor white trash,,I definitely had issues with feeling,less and wanting to not feel the way.,There are times where,I got bullied and I hated it.,I hated that feeling.,I hated that feeling,of vulnerability.,I get him a book,by Arnold Schwarzenegger,and he read the whole thing.,And I told him, I says: ""Well,,you do everything that Arnold did,and you'll be like that, you know."",Well, he took it seriously.,

,I started high school,at 118 pounds,,I ended up at 180 pounds,and the strongest kid around.,The harder I pushed the weights, the bigger,and stronger I got, the better I felt.,This is my high school,football photo.,On our games days,,the guys would wear their jerseys and then,the girls would wear their,cheerleader outfits to school.,And me, I'd be sitting there in class with,my jersey on and I'd be looking at them,and wondering what it,be like to switch places,and be in their place.,That was something that...,That it's never,been out of my mind,for five minutes my entire life.,It was something you just,thought about all day,,every day.,And...,I always been there...,And it tortured me for,a really, really long time.,And this is my picture,with President Clinton.,I actually have taken,in the Oval Office.,Part of my reason for,joining the Marines was,to challenge myself,to make my own way.,And it was another way to push,the feminine feelings down,and really focus on,the masculine stuff.,If there was any period in my life,I really overdid the macho thing,,that was definitely,during that Marines.,First bodybuilder show.,This is right after,I got out of the Marines.,Grabbed this championship,,Matt Kroczaleski.,You go, Matt.,You're looking good.,Oh, yeah, nice job, Matt.,Look at his abs. Good abs.,I can tell you that just,being big and muscular means,the vast majority of people,aren't gonna mess with you.,It makes the odds of running into,trouble in that way much, much lower.,Right after that is when I got,real serious about powerlifting.,Come on, come on!,Feeling less than everyone else,,I had this really,deep desire to win.,Come on, Matt.,Easy.,That's good.,It's my hun.,And as I grew, I met my wife.,And while the marriage didn't,last, my three sons,became the most important,thing in my life.,It's Christmas 2007.,Good morning, Maxx.,Good morning, Dad.,Yeah, it's a turtle.,- Go.,Go, go, go.,I loved my father,,but he simply wasn't there.,Oh, turtle!,Let me see, guys. Do you like them?,- Yes.,Woo-hoo.,- I like mine a lot.,Thanks, Dad.,- You're welcome, buddy.,It didn't matter if I was lying,down for bed, I was thinking about lifting.,Waking up first thing in the morning,,I was thinking about it.,You know, I'd be sitting in pharmacy,school during lectures and, hum, you know,,and... you know,,I did alright and everything,,but I--,I would be thinking about lifting.,Yeah.,Yeah!,I was the first powerlifter picked,by a major supplement company.,Being big and strong,,it gave me a sense of self.,It gave me an identity.,I was the crazy guy,,the tough guy, the intense guy,,the one that,could take anything.,My identity wasn't Matt.,It was Kroc.,By the time I was done,,I had bench pressed 738 pounds,,squatted 1,003, deadlifted 810,,and the world record was mine.,Compared to everyone my size,,I was the strongest man on the planet.,But I felt like the person I was,,was completely constructed.,There was a whole, whole,bunch that was missing.,And I didn't know if there was,anything about me that was authentic.,My family had known for years,that I was transgender,,but to the outside world,,I was still Kroc.,More than once I have gotten,dressed up and broke down crying,when I look in the mirror and just so,unhappy with my body and how I looked and,my lack of ability to, you know,,look feminine in the way that I wanted to.,What's up, everybody?,What you are looking at are,pictures of a famous,bodybuilder/powerlifter.,His name is Matt Kroc.,Right now,that is a new Instagram.,This time around, under,the name of Janae Marie Kroc.,As you guys can appreciate the back,gains are absolutely still loyal,in my reckoning even though,we cannot see it quite clearly.,This is a front lat spread,,definitely a sight to be seen,,and the mass is still,,actually, amazing.,When that video went public,,I decided it was time to stop hiding.,If my story was gonna be told, I wanted,to be the one who was going to tell it.,Yes. OK, we're good,now, we're good now.,Alright, well, we're here,today with a very special guest.,We're here with Janae Kroc,,and we got a lot of interesting and,awesome things to get to today.,I mean, I didn't want any of this,,that's what people don't understand.,I mean, I fought this as hard as,I could, as long as I could.,Uhm, this isn't what I wanted. This was,never a choice. You know, this is like...,It's either this or be miserable,,you know, forever, and, uhm...,You know, at one point it drove,me to consider suicide, and,to be honest, this will be the,biggest challenge I've ever faced,,way harder than,any of the injuries,or even cancer for me.,Uhm, this is way,more difficult.,When did you have cancer?,- Back in 2004.,Testicular cancer, ironically,,and I remember thinking,,""God, I hope it spreads everywhere,,and they have to remove everything."",I knew, like, being a pharmacist,and having a medical background,,I knew that's not how,the cancer spreads.,That's how overwhelming,this feeling was to need to be female.,- That's crazy.,You're very physical, I mean,,you had world records,in powerlifting,,a former marine, in general,,just a fucking badass,,so it's not like you're saying,you're a girly girl, but--,Right, but yeah...,When it comes to being a dude,,you were a tough motherfucker.,Yeah, and thank you.,It sounds funny coming out,of me now, but,,That's the nicest,thing anyone's ever said.,Janae, don't break down.,The hardest thing,with my failed,transition attempts,in the past was,,there's only two things,really on my mind:,Being comfortable letting go,of all that muscle,and all that strength,because not only,you know, did I enjoy those,things for competition and stuff,,but it was a safety blanket,and always has been.,But then also, how is this,gonna affect my boys?,They're a hundred percent supportive.,I mean, they've been telling me for years,,you know, ""Do what you need to do. We,love you either way. It doesn't matter."",But they're going from having,the world champion powerlifter,,super-dad that everyone looks up,to, everybody loves their...,I mean, the coaches,and stuff all love me.,Now they're gonna,have the transgender dad.,That was very permanent.,- It is.,You know, and for them to say,,""Hey, go do your thing"",is really cool,,but I think at the same time,,it's good that you're recognizing,that it's different, you know.,So, you said you're kind,of transitioning now,,and you said that kind of,means losing weight?,So, at this point,,I am cutting weight.,Uhm, I've restarted,female hormones.,I'm moving forward with it.,Is it a hundred percent?,I've started and stopped,five times before.,So, there's...,You know, never say never.,At first, you know,,the attempt to transition was just,dieting for a few months,,stopping lifting.,In my most recent attempt last year,,I had dropped my lifting weight back,and started taking female hormones,,and before I decided that,,""You know what,,I can't do this."",After that, I came back, and,I got bigger than I'd ever been.,For me, to be the woman that,I want to be in appearance,and physical form,,might not be possible.,I don't think I am comfortable,as an extremely muscular woman,,but as a guy, that's the only way,I'm comfortable. So, what do I do?,Hey, guys.,Finally made it, huh?,How's your day been?,- Nice day.,It's good to see you, guys.,- I know, it is.,I just saw you a couple of days ago.,- I know. It was nice.,Got to see your,football game, too.,Maxx, where's my hug, man?,- Just got my pillowcase.,I don't know why,I always bring one.,Why do you bring,a pillowcase with you?,Garret, can you do it today?,Tonight, I'm gonna go out to a club,and stay out. You guys wanna come?,We can't. Logan can.,- I'll sneak you in, get you some beers.,A pillowcase, dude, when are you,gonna get a backpack or something?,I don't know.,- I know, that...,OK, my buddy,,we might have some,of the stuff for the Camaro.,It was running really smooth, but then it,was bogging when I'd open all the way up,,especially about three,,and especially about 4,000.,So basically, I'm going into each,one of these little cells, and...,Usually you make slight adjustments?,- Yeah.,You never want to make,big adjustments.,That's how you blow motors up.,Logan, do you,understand this stuff?,Not all, not a hundred,percent of it, but yes.,Neither do I.,- I don't get it, how you guys know that.,OK, so do you... OK, what don't you,understand, Maxx? What does the spark mean?,I explained to you like the,compression stroke, right?,No, like, just everything.,Like how many... Everything?,- Everything about it.,Is everybody buckled in?,- I'm buckled.,Yeah, I am.,- Dad, I only get like,one of those words,you just said.,I was like,,""What's spark?"",You'll learn, Maxx, you'll learn.,- Hold on to it.,I'm really, really fortunate,to have three amazing boys.,I told them about being a girl,when they were two, four, and six.,I'm a very big believer,in honesty and openness,,so I didn't feel it was,right to keep it from them.,The hair says no.,The hair says no.,Oh, no.,Hey, that's not fair.,Good job.,Pull the pants.,- O, get... Hold on.,We got speed.,Argh!,- Yeah!,No rematch. We're done.,- No rematch.,Alright.,I might try,that on and see,how that's gonna look.,Actually,,I might give that a try too.,Oh... We'll see.,Nah, it's a little bit burly. Don't think,I really like the way it hangs on my body.,Think I wanna go with the other,shirt, actually.,Yes, that should work for the white theme,and... And wear these boots with them.,Just a little more dramatic and the,makeup and hair... it should be fun.,Clothes aren't designed very well for me,and especially, being as big as I am.,So we go through the same thing,,like when a girl starts,playing with makeup,,when she's a teenager,,how to best apply,your makeup and,what clothes work with,your body and what doesn't.,Whose water is this?,Is this you guys' water?,Huh? Yeah, it's mine.,Shoot, it's out.,Oh! Aaron Black.,- No, no. Dude, I'm not gonna play with you.,Dude, Aaron Black is like cheating.,- Yes.,He just shoots you with,the gun in broad light.,Dude, no. Don't Aaron Black.,That's so mean.,People can say whatever,,but the only thing that do frustrate me is,when they talk about like, you know,,""what a terrible parent, how...,You know, horrible that is. How can you do,that to your boys"" and stuff like that.,It's like, ""You know what? Screw you guys.,You have no idea what our life is like."",It's just that,assumption that it's...,you know, that it's somehow a horrible,thing and somehow it's difficult for them.,But really, it's been a good thing,because it's allowed them realize,,grow up realizing that not,everybody's the same and that's OK.,And you're happier,,which is great too.,I don't know, I just thought you,were like holding back and stuff.,Well, yeah, because I didn't want you,guys to have to deal with a lot of BS.,Who cares about what other people say or,,you know, tell you can't do this or that.,I think what it really all boils down to,,if you want to do something, go and do it.,You're the only person,holding yourself back.,That's what you,really taught me.,I cannot think of a single person,,I respect more than my father.,Saying there's really nobody, right?,- I really can't.,Thanks, guys.,Made me cry.,Ruin my makeup.,Good thing,,I haven't done my eyes yet.,How long have you,been doing makeup for?,I started really, like,,When your mom and I split.,I had a talk with her,and, uhm, said, like,,""Look, I have to deal with this.,I can't do this anymore."",As far as she would come, is that:,""Just do it, when I'm not home,,the boys aren't home, I don't want to,see it. I don't want to hear about it.,I don't want to talk about it."",And I was like,,Yeah, I don't know,if that's gonna work, but...,So, that's basically one of,the reasons we split up.,Pizza and makeup, huh?,Our new Friday nights?,Whoa, whoa, whoa.,- That's not even cool.,Wait, Garret, can I,test out my move now?,All right guys, don't be up,too late, alright?,Guys, just the perfect timing.,- Are you leaving?,U-hum, hang on one second,,I got to put my boots on first.,Mom.,- Mom?,Don't drink too much.,Don't drink too much?,What fun is that?,At least it's nice out.,I'll get your first round, OK?,- What's up, dude?,I'll give you,your first round.,OK, thank you. Appreciate it.,Full-size glass.,- Thanks.,You're a rock-star.,Like I said, that bartender,back there, he totally like...,I'll take it, whatever.,Going out as a transgender,woman and not, you know,,passing as a genetic female,,it's tough, it's hard.,You know, and I think, gosh,,can I really pull this off?,You know,,is it really gonna work?,Am I gonna to have peace? Am I gonna to,feel whole? Am I gonna to feel complete?,Am I gonna be able to, you now, function in,society the way I want to? Is this for real?,Hey. Good. How are you?,- How are you?

Sure.,That's easy for you to say.,You think it's easy for me? Don't you,think it's harder for me than you?,No.,- No?,For you it's so natural.,Yeah.,As a guy, I hear from women,all the time they love my voice.,It's naturally deep. As a girl,,it makes me very uncomfortable, and...,It's like my female voice,leaves a lot to be desired.,The vocal surgery, it had,to be something, well...,I'm 100% ready to,give up my guy side.,You know, it's one of those things,that I can't do, or I won't do,unless I was ready to,completely transition.,I would be much more comfortable,having bottom surgery and,still living in both genders.,The fact that whether I have a penis or,vagina isn't that big of a deal to me.,That really has more,to do with who I'm with.,But the vocal surgery, once you got a,female voice, there's no going back.,He's here.,Hi, honey.,- Hi, nice to see you.,It's not a big deal, is it?,- No.,But, uhm... I still like my man.,Well, for now, they're still,both of me are still around,,but I can't tell you that,it'll stay that way or not.,And I guess I'm not as shocked about,you because the ones I see on TV.,I mean, they look like a man trying,to be a woman.

Would you,think that was her hair?,No.,No. You would think it is.,Looks natural, right?,- Yeah.,I didn't know.,It looks natural.,And it's not.,When Matt first called me,,for a while, I grieved.,I actually...,I couldn't sort my feelings.,I thought, ""Why in hell?"",I'm... But it was almost like Matt died.,I talked to my middle son,and he said the same thing.,He said, ""I love Matt.,I don't know this Janae.,Matt is my buddy, my brother.,We grew up, we did the guy,things.""

I'll bring the boys.,I was glad to see Matt succeed,at what he'd been,doing all his life.,And, I mean,,he worked hard at it. And...,Neither me or my wife, you know, ever dreamed,that, you know, he'd get as far as he did.,I'd see him stick with it.,You know.,Yeah, well, things are going,down a different path now.,Well, you're 40 what now?,- Three.,43.,Yeah, my competitive days,are pretty much over now.,It's just between age,being a factor and then,,you know, the transgender stuff.,Can't figure--,- That's my hope,,you change your mind,about it before it's too late.,You know, It's not a matter,of changing the minds, you know.,You can't change your way.,You'll wind up,like Bruce Jenner...,with severe depression.,Don't believe everything...,- That happens a lot.,Oh, sure it does.,It's not an easy life.,You know, it's changing and...,- Well, you better be sure.,That's all I got to say,'cause you can't go back.,And if you show up here with your long,hair and boobs, I'm going the other way.,Oh, really?,- Yeah.,Yeah?

I've seen,one picture, got freaked on that.,Whatever you,call yourself.,This is, uhm,,where I grew up at.,Oh, yeah, the secret,basement back here.,You'd flip up a door and,there was a ladder down into it,and for a while, it was,my dad's pot-growing house.,We weren't allowed down there. We were,told there was dangerous chemicals.,We just didn't know,they were THC.,This big oak back here,,I built a tree fort in.,Some of the boards are,still hanging in the tree.,Down here,,there's a big sand hill.,I used to sprint up,and down this.,With a... I used to carry,a big log on my back,,and I'd run up,and down this hill.,This is where we came to fish,in the spring and in the fall,and I learned how to swim in the,river and almost died in the river.,I almost drowned there,when I was eight.,Fell into a drop-off,and with the current,,I remember falling through the water,and seeing the sunlight disappear.,Seeing everything turn green and,then seeing everything turn black.,There are times,when I wanted to get away and,I wanted quiet and peace,,this is where I'd come.,I would just sit there on the,bank and look into the water.,Yeah, it's crazy actually,,how much this looks exactly the same.,These are my fishing stuff,from the spring.,Hey!,- Hey you.

It's like, argh!,Cheers. It's lovely, lovely to see you.,- Thank you. Yes.,I have a billion questions, but I've none,at the same time. You know what I mean?,I still... I still would like to have a,little facial surgery done, but I'm not...,Like, I'm kind of hesitant,to do it because...,I like how I look now, uhm, but I would,still like to look more feminine.,'Cause, like, I feel like with,makeup and stuff I look okay,,but without any makeup or anything,,I think I still look very masculine, so...,Just being smaller all together,has made a difference and,then just the estrogen and,not tons of testosterone, and...,Do you find you need to see,someone to kind of guide you?,Like would you see,a counselor or anybody?,I did a lot of therapy stuff,when I was first,dealing with everything.,For me, it was really no...,more helpful than just,talking to one of my friends.,Just someone I could,bounce stuff off of.,I don't know, like...,My sexual, I'm still...,It's difficult because,I'm still primarily,attracted to women,,always have been, still am.,It's just once you get,to the bedroom then it's like,,""Okay, how do things work,now?"" That's the tricky part.,OK, so, the two,options for tonight...,This one actually,,for whatever reason,,my body looks more,feminine in this one.,It's supposed to throw,the waist shaper thing on.,I could throw the top on,right here and then,I'll change the pants.,OK, sorry I got to throw,some money at you,,one sec.,I'm sorry to disappoint you.,- I don't have no $5 bills.,I'm fatter and smaller,than I used to be, so...,Alright, the favorite shirt.,Yeah. Here we go.,It's been pre-selected.,Yeah, like I said, like I love this shirt.,I absolutely love it.,I love the design, I think it's,really cool and everything, but...,I don't think it makes you,look wider or bigger.,You don't think so?,- No.,Woo-hoo!,Like the white?,- OK, the ass.,It's not bad.,It's not bad at all.,What are you talking about?,- Seriously?,They're shaped.,I do have a big butt,,everybody said that.,Ugh, I don't know,if I'm up to 170s.,Maybe drop her down to 150s.,I'll take those for a ride.,Fucking 150s.,Let's go.,Come on, let's go.,Let's go!,Good, come on.,Push, push!,Nice job.,Come on Drew, let's go.,Easy weight for you, buddy.,Let's go.,Come on, Drew, let's go.,Let's go, Drew.,Get out to this shit.,- Come on!,Alright, Drew, let's go.,Come on, sit nice and tight.,Don't be a pussy.,Get up, up, up.,- Easy.,Let's go.,Fucking pussy weight.,Let's go, bitch.,Let's go, man, come on.,Good.

You know, it's...,Loving this stuff and,hanging out with these guys.,You know, this is the kind of shit,that I still live for too, you know.,So, it makes it...,It makes it hard, but...,These guys have seen me go back and forth,,probably more times than they can count.,I think there'll always be too,much Matt for Janae to be a...,And being a woman.,If you want to say a stereotype woman.,The... the 120 pounds.,That'll never happen.,That... That...,Not because, to be honest--,- He couldn't do it.,He couldn't do it because this guy,,his fuck-- his mentality,,he can do whatever he wants,to do, but he wouldn't be happy.,I don't think he can do it.,I don't think you can go to 200 again.,I think you're probably right.,- That's what I'm trying to say so...,Whether it's Janae or Matt,,fitness is number one.,Always gonna be,number one in the family.,But fitness, he'll never allow,himself to get that small again.,I was like, ""Fuck that.,I won't be 275 again."",But these guys are, you know,,my very best friends and it is,,it's like brothers. I mean,,I count on these guys for anything, and...,Fuck, I get choked up.,I count on these guys,for anything, and...,The way it should be.,It doesn't matter, I mean, it doesn't matter,if I'm... Even with the transition stuff.,It's just, you know...,Yeah.,You know, they are, they're,like brothers, really.,Right now,,there's just this feeling,of being pulled,between two worlds and,this, you know, complete,frustration and how am I,ever gonna find,peace and balance, and...,And at this point, I really think,the honest answer is, I won't.,Being told that my,hair loss is beyond the point,where I can actually grow,it out, that was devastating,to hear because putting a wig,on for me feels like costume,,it feels like dress up,,it feels like pretending.,This conference sounds,like it's gonna be...,It's a little bit of a cluster.,Fortunately, I've been,doing this stuff for years.,I've run meets,,spotted, loaded, judged.,I've done pretty much,everything you can do,with all the powerlifting,stuff for a long time.,I don't think anybody there really,has any experience with it.,They didn't really know,what they're getting into.,Fortunately, there's not,a ton of competitors,,so we should,pull it off okay.,This event is specifically,for transgender competitors.,I'll be kind of, you know, basically,helping them run the competition,,judge, and probably be a Jill,of all trades tomorrow, so...,Alright.

Papachenko (2020) - full transcript,"The story of a brilliant coach who raised a great champion, winner, and man. Anatoliy Lomachenko - father and coach of Vasiliy Lomachenko. In the world of big boxing known as Papachenko","I've got so many memories from this gym.,And all of them are good ones.,This is where it all started.,This is where I worked so hard.,This is where I spent many hours,,many days.,On these stairs, it was always packed.,Guys came, and everyone,changed on the stairs,because the benches had,no room for everyone.,In those two square meters,,there wasn't room for all of us.,Lots of people and everyone,changed on the stairs.,It’s all permeated not only,with Vasiliy’s sweat.,
,
,
,So many students passed through this,place... It all started in this basement.,There was no proper ventilation,,everyone was pouring,,you couldn't breathe,,but they kept working.,But I say it's a boxing Mecca.,I work at a school, and I tell children:,""You should know that,it's a boxing Mecca.,This is where Vasiliy and Anatoliy,worked, and their aura is still there”.,One!,Two!,Three!,Four!,Five!,Six!,Seven!,
,
,
,Eight!,Nine!,Ninety! It’s great!,This is where I set plenty,of my personal records.,It’s all recorded, we’ve got video.,Including the famous 250th pull-up,on this bar.,I come in and see that,Vasya is doing pull-ups.,I say, “Vasya, how many,pull-ups do you do?"",I think it was 40 or 50,,but that isn't important.,He's pulling up but,cannot go all the way,,and he says, ""Dad, I can't do it!"",Anatoliy Nikolayevich says,,“No questions, get back down.,In that case, it’s not going to work.”,And Vasya is in tears,and keeps pulling up.,I thought to myself that I would,never have been able to do that.,That was his father,,but it was already evident what,path he was directing him to.,I asked him, which is better to win,,what is more prestigious:,The World Championship,or the Olympic Games?,I remember it as if it were,just a moment ago.,We were going up the stairs,from the basement.,And he explained to me that the Olympics,are held every four years,and that is the most,prestigious competition.,The Olympic champion stays,in history. It's the top.,It's the highest peak that,one can climb in sports.,And after that, I told him that,I was going to be an Olympic champion.,It was their common dream.,Back then, it seemed,,such an unrealistic one.,Because the boy who dreamed of Olympic,gold was barely acquainted with boxing.,And his father was a claimant,of a Master of Sports title,,a children sports trainer from,a small town of Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy.,This is Lomachenko's home town.,From here Anatoliy Nikolayevich,went to do,his military service,where he started boxing.,This is where he returned,to after he got married,and graduated from,the Institute of Pedagogy.,He became a father: first, his son,was born, then the daughter.,He taught physical culture at a school.,Also, he held an extracurricular,boxing class at the school gym,,which Vasiliy attended as well.,Soon enough, the trainer and the young,boxers moved from the school basement,to much more convenient premises -,the gym of the Akkerman boxing club.,This name became world-famous,due to the Lomachenko father,and his son.,They progressed together,and grew in sync.,One - as a boxer,,the other - as a trainer.,Their tandem soon became,well-known in Ukraine.,And after that ― in the world.,Because Lomachenko won,against each and every one.,As an amateur, he held around,four hundred fights,and accepted defeat only once!,Vasiliy is referred to as,one of the strongest,and most technical fighters,in the history of boxing.,He won European and,world championships.,He even exceeded his old dream,by winning the Olympic gold twice.,Together they went,into professional boxing.,In this status, Vasiliy keeps conquering,the champion's belts,and setting new records.,He is recognized as the best,professional boxer in the world.,And Anatoliy Nikolayevich -,as the best trainer.,So, now two people with,the Lomachenko name,are written into the history of boxing,,both amateur and professional.,Keep going, keep going!,Like that, stretch it! Just like that!,Good job!,Do it! Pull!,Stomach! Stomach!,Stomach!,No sleeping, no sleeping!,Stretch it!,Arena: Vasya! Vasya!,Another victory and another record.,Another ovation from the filled,to the brink boxing arena -,one of the largest in the world.,A transition to pro turned into a fiasco,for many a distinguished amateur boxer...,but the Lomachenko pair continued to,dominate completely in the new status.,Whoa!,Vasiliy boxed for all the age groups,in the Ukrainian national team...,Vasya, the one in the front!,And his father was with him in,all the camps and all the fights.,Usually, next to the head trainer,of the team.,Watch it!,Like that, good! Turn him around!,Three! Three hits!,- Hit!,- Stretch! Stretch!,Just like that, good!,Lomachenko has never been,a head trainer of a national team.,Perhaps, if he'd wished to, he might,have been the head of the head team.,He worked not only with his son,but with several other boxers,,who were drawn to him by the force,of Vasiliy's achievements.,The victory goes,to Vasyl Lomachenko, Ukraine!,In clubs and in gyms, when people,talked about fighters who show,extraordinary results for their age, you,could hear, ""Lom, Lom, Lomachenko.”,Where is he from?,Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy.,Who is training him?,His dad is his trainer.,No doubt, Vasya is the engine,of this whole team.,I doubt that Vasya,looked up to any of us.,We were all probably looking up to him.,Because they train through,some inhuman workload.,At that moment, it seemed to be,something from the fantastic realm.,But when you see that someone,is capable of doing that,,you yourself find motivation.,You push yourself.,Maybe none of us could do what,Vasya did. But, at least, we tried.,And we’ve all improved our results.,Everything happened exclusively,in an autonomous mode.,“You’re big guys. Do you want gold?,Then you'll need to work hard!”,If you’re wishy-washy - then you,might work or you might not,,and that’s what you,get in the end.,Everyone worked extra hard -,we swam and ran.,Vasiliy and I ran 42 kilometers.,Olexandr Gvozdyk came to our,camp in Koncha-Zaspa and ran,42 kilometers on his own. Anatoliy,Nikolayevich drove by him in a car.,As a professional, Vasiliy does,not train in a team anymore.,He prepares for every fight by,an individually-tailored curriculum.,But other boxers always,work by his side.,Some ― regularly, some ― sporadically.,Anatoliy Lomachenko never,denies help to any of them.,Working with other boxers,,Anatoliy Nikolayevich structures,the class in away,that not only promotes,their physical fitness,but always includes,a competitive element.,Head and knees!,Sanya is a live wire.,Lets go, Alex!,Last round!,I think he's a leader,from the inside out.,And he's not a person of two minds.,He might not say something outright.,But I think he's a single-minded person.,He can persuade you.,He can get the message across,in a way that leaves no doubt.,I feel great respect toward him.,Because he took me and,turned me around as a boxer.,Sometimes I don’t entirely agree,with what Anatoliy Nikolayevich says.,But later it often turns out,that I really had to do,exactly what he’d said.,He’d say: “Hit the right,punch from the bottom."",And you think that this punch won't,pass, it won't come through.,But if he says so,,it will go right through.,That's the way it is. That's what,happens when you trust a person.,And considering his results with Vasya,,and what he achieved with our,other teams, with our WSB team,,there are all the right,reasons to trust him.,After the Olympics,,Anatoliy Nikolayevich gave an interview.,He was asked somewhere,at the airport, and he replied,,“If the trainer says you need,to hit your head against the wall,,you must hit your head,against the wall!”,And that phrase made the headlines.,At first, you don’t get it.,What kind of trainer is it that tells you,to beat your head against the wall?,It seems anti-pedagogical. But in,reality, the meaning is different.,If I ask you to do something,potentially risky,,and we agreed that you trust me,,that's what you must do.,That’s what it looked like.,You need to do 70 pull-ups today.,So, you do them until you hit 50-55,,you’re so tired you can’t go on.,You can’t go on ― okay, then stop.,He'd never say he's tired. We might,complain, and I tell him about it,,he'd say, ""Yeah, that happens."",But he'd never say, ""Oh, poor you."",That was the way he was,brought up - nobody pitied him.,And he doesn’t pity anyone.,You want it ― do it.,You don’t want it ― don’t do it.,That’s your right.,He says, “If you don’t want to do it,,you don’t have to. You can skip it.”,Skip it? Yes, based on,how you’re feeling.,I don’t know how it happens. But,there hasn’t been a single time,that I gave up after I said,I couldn't do it anymore.,He says, ""There is no 'cannot, ',only 'don't want to.'"",- That's it.,- All done?,Give me three more passes.,""There is no such thing as ‘I can't.',There's only ‘I don't want to.',If you want to, you can do,anything at all times."",That is how Lomachenko Sr.,Brought up his son.,Vasiliy named his son,after his father. Anatoliy.,And Tolik also learns Grandpa's,lessons from the earliest childhood.,Get up! Well done. Two!,Come on, come on. Whoa, three!,Come on! Five!,Come on!,Six!,Great job! That’s it?,Oh, you can do more? Come on!,Seven! Well done!,Whoa! Eight!,Can you do one more time?,Just the last one, the final one.,Na, he didn’t... he did! Wonderful!,Can you do one more? Just one?,Come on, just one and you’re free.,Do it!,Great job!,Lomachenko, the trainer, taught Vasiliy,from the early days to be the winner.,The father taught his son,to be human. Always.,Victories are great.,But they are not primary.,If I was guilty of something...,The first time he warned me:,""I'm not going to raise my hand on you.,I'm not going to beat you with a belt.,But for every wrongdoing,,you will learn a poem by heart.,Any one you want.,Take any book, open it,,choose a page, a poem,,and learn it. Get it?”,I said, yes, I get it.,But in just a few days,I had to face the music.,I used a bad word somewhere. Either he,heard it himself, or someone told him.,“Come here! We agreed?”,Agreed.,“It happened?” It happened.,“Choose your poem!”,I chose Alexander Pushkin’s poem,and started drilling it.,The boys came all day long and,asked me whether I was going out.,I said, sorry guys, I can’t,,I need to learn a poem.,A father and a trainer. But also -,a teacher and a mentor.,Anatoliy Lomachenko did not,only teach Vasiliy boxing.,As well as sporting experience,,he also passed his life,experience to his son.,He has always done it as tactfully,as when talking on sports topics.,He never demanded but advised.,He was never stubborn but persuasive -,since he always said the right things.,More than a boxer -,even an Olympic champion -,Anatoliy wanted to bring his son up,to be a real man and a decent person.,The Black Sea is twenty,kilometers from home.,And the Dniester estuary is even nearby.,These are the beaches where,Anatoliy Lomachenko,would bring Vasily in his childhood,not to swim and sunbathe however.,But work hard, training in the sand.,So look, you need to make two passes,about thirty seconds each.,Temp - just above average.,Not rushing, but going smoothly.,Proper wide steps, got it?,Those umbrellas over there, by,the fence ― that’s where you start.,Gesture when you’re ready.,I will gesture back at you.,Then you start and I keep the time.,So let’s get this rolling...,And how will I understand,when it’s been 30 already?,I’m telling you it’s gonna be,roughly that.,Hey, it was a joke! Hey!,What gives? Come on, stop.,Let’s do this!,Stand on your palms, then try,to switch to the fists.,Keep your weight on one hand,while you switch with the other.,Come on. Try it.,- Yup. Feeling all right?,- Yeah!,Stand on your fingers.,Now on your fists again.,Push-up.,Back on your fingers.,Give me ten.,- Do two passes like this.,- Two?,Just mind this: first you switch,between fingers and fists five times.,You do one pushup on your fists,,then one on your fingers.,- One more.,- I did two!,- You made the switch.,- I did ten push-ups!,- One on your fingers, one on your fists.,- And so you repeat ten times.,You’re doing it wrong.,You need to throw it first, so he runs,,and then you start, otherwise he...,That’s the best way,to do it, you see why?,Here it comes!,Making a pass!,Fire in the hole!,There you go, there you go!,Good!,- Score? Three-Three?,- Four-Four.,- Out!,- No!,Anatoliy Lomachenko taught,not only boxing to his son.,Wrestling, rowing, acrobatics, tennis,,athletic marathon, swimming,across the estuary.,Also, team sports: hockey,,basketball, volleyball.,Even before Vasiliy,became a champion,,his father turned him,into a real athlete.,They both feel confident,on most sportive grounds.,And Anatoliy organizes and is an active,participant of every competition,that Lomachenkos regularly hold,among their team and friends.,That only confirms that,another person would say,,“Why are you telling me this?,Can you do it on your own?”,He can do everything on his own.,Good!,He plays with us. He does,everything better, for sure.,When we boxed as amateurs,,he trained every day with us.,He went for runs.,- I thought that the way he played tennis.,- He could have won against Nadal.,Tennis for sure.,As a rule, Lomachenkos,play against each other.,For Vasiliy, it's a real competition,because he strives to win at everything.,But Anatoliy Nikolayevich,trains even as he plays.,In most games that we play,,be it volleyball or tennis,,he sometimes goes easy on us.,When Vasya notices that,,he gets nervous, starts yelling,,and does the same.,But that's the way Anatoliy Nikolayevich,maintains the microclimate in the team.,When he sees that it’s unnecessary,,he, on the contrary,,plays in a way that keeps you,on your toes even more.,Out!,It is 0-7!,Well done! Look what he's doing!,- Six - Three!,- Five - Four!,We may be losing by five points, and,he’s adding those points to our score!,I ask Anatoliy Nikolayevich,,how did that happen?,Aren’t we five points down?,He says I’ve counted wrong,and we’re five points up.,So, at some point,,Andrey Borisovich suggested that I just,play without keeping count of the score.,And I decided to play that way, and then,he tells us the score. Agree? Agree.,Good job!,Well done!,Five-Four.,Thought you weren’t gonna do it.,- Everyone is waiting for you!,- It’s time?,- Yes. Been time for a while, son.,- Let’s go!,- No sleeping on the job!,- Yeah!,No sleeping!,Enough!,- Didn’t see that one coming?,- Nope.,We haven’t been over,that during trainings.,I’ve been saving that up,for the camera.,Dad, get it together!,That’s not what we agreed on!,Good job tying these.,- Who tied them?,- You hit so hard the gloves are breaking.,I’ll show you later how Mayweather,works with the boxing pads.,In a pro category, Lomachenkos set,the most ambitious goals at the outset -,and set out to achieve them at once.,Titles, earnings, and fame -,these are important, of course.,But their main desire and impetus,is to write their name,into the history of professional boxing.,Come on, Dad!,Vasiliy became World Champion,in his third fight.,In the seventh fight, he established,a record in the number of fights,it took him to earn the titles,from two different categories.,He defended the champion's title,by destroying his opponents.,Four elite boxers in,a row admitted defeat,prematurely in their,matches with Vasiliy.,He received a nickname ""No Mas."",In Spanish, this means,""enough,"" ""no more."",Soon enough, Vasiliy won a title,in the next weight category,and set another record.,It only took him twelve fights to become,a champion in three different categories.,Two Lomachenkos: a father and a son.,Now both of them are famous.,And, it seems, are equally popular.,Lomachenko’ fans: Loma! Loma!,- Lomachenko’ fans: Dyadya Tolya!,- Dyadya Tolya!!,Lomachenko’ fans: Dyadya Tolya!,Dyadya Tolya!,A pro boxer must have a nickname.,Vasiliy transferred to pro with,the one he had as an amateur.,""High-tech."",Figuratively, a boxer,who is ahead of his time.,A new nickname was even,more ambitious in meaning.,""Matrix."" A hint that its holder,fights on a fantastical level!,This is how Vasiliy,is called by journalists,when they describe his technique,,speed, or another victory.,""No Mas."" This nickname,stuck to Vasiliy,after four boxers in a row,gave up in a fight with him.,But it did not become primary.,Who would like to be called ""enough""?,There were other options,,but in the end,,Vasiliy decided to stick to the one,his supporters gave him.,To the word that the arena,chants during the fight.,Laconic, loud, and severe,,and now also recognizable,across the globe. LOMA.,Camera Papachenko!,Okay, Team Loma, let's go!,The transformation of the last name,gave a nickname to Anatoliy,Nikolayevich as well.,In the end ― five dropped letters,from the son's name.,And it begins with a word,that is so important to Vasiliy.,It turned out soulful and so precise.,PAPA-CHENKO.,I told them to give me that one.,Let's hang it here.,No, we’ll put it over there, because,that’s what I usually work with.,- All right, put the big one over there.,- Yes, sure.,Vasliliy's professional career,is developing in a way,that both he and his father have to,spend more and more time in the USA.,And the issue with the training,conditions has arisen.,At first, Lomachenkos went,to a common boxing gym.,They spent a couple of hours,every day commuting,,remembering the Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy,Akkerman.,And then ― they recreated,their native gym.,It is virtually identical,,just a little smaller.,A small Akkerman.,- Maybe higher?,- Let’s see. They’re gonna let go now.,- Higher?,- Nah, I think that’s enough.,That’s enough.,But they are still more comfortable,in the real Akkerman.,Lomachenkos set up the gym,with special feelings.,This is the place where they prepared,to most of their victories...,Okay, observe!,And this is where they lived through,the hardest times of their work together.,- Maybe the other way around?,- The big carbiner goes on top.,- Am I on time?,- Just on time!,So I felt. Here I come.,- Maybe even higher?,- Dunno, I think it’s enough.,- Let’s do one link higher.,- One link higher.,Let’s go. Put it down?,Nah, it’s okay. We’ll hold it,,easier that way.,I’m holding it, you’re holding onto it.,- I’m assisting.,- So I see.,Now we’re talking! Now it’s my height.,Whole two centimeters,,a world of difference!,Thanks, Alex!,At the beginning of his,professional career,,there was an episode when Vasya said,,he thought something,was unnecessary to do.,And in the end, the trainer agreed.,If you consider that unnecessary,,do what you feel is right.,The camp is almost done.,Everyone's at the end of the rope.,No nerves, no strength left, all that.,Vasiliy Anatolievich is,a temperamental person.,Sometimes he says,something to his father.,Anatoliy Nikolayevich,always responds calmly,,""You don't want it, don't do it.,If you know all that you need to do."",Yes, I won't do it! -,Says Vasiliy and leaves.,I say, “Vasiliy, what’s up with you, it,was all well. Why don’t you just do it?”,He says, have you done it? You go do it!,I say, I did it, and you should do it,,maybe later.,He says, I won’t do it!,Vasiliy Anatolievich, as usual,,yelled a bit, grumbled a bit.,It seemed to me that,I knew more than he did.,And we started having,confrontations on that ground.,He tells me to do something,,and I think otherwise.,He says, “No question, you know,everything, you train yourself.”,That’s it. And when I started training,myself, I realized that I knew nothing.,Neither how to train, nor how to reach,the peak of my fitness form.,Until the moment when everything,went back to normal,,it was your responsibility,,I will do what I’ve planned.,It took some time.,That time wasn’t wasted,,but a constructive conflict took place.,Since that time, I cannot remember,any serious issues.,There are everyday incidents,,but we only laugh at them.,As a rule, Lomachenko's,preparation for the fight,lasts for the standard three,months, which are divided,into two equal parts of,physical training and sparrings.,But sometimes, Anatoliy Nikolayevich,makes changes to the schedule.,For instance, if the date of,the match has been moved.,In contents, his camp is always,different from what other boxers do.,The spars, for example, can,last for up to fifteen rounds.,Who knows if Vasiliy works longer,or harder than other boxers.,But he surely works in a particular way.,Physically exhausted.,Mentally emptied out.,During the training camp, Vasiliy works,on the edge of human capacity.,Possibly, even beyond the edge.,He happens to be irritated.,But he and his father are,the closest people in the world.,In the end, they always agree,,and the workouts continue,according to the plan,of Lomachenko Senior.,There are moments sometimes,when we analyze:,what’s going to happen when,Vasya has to do this?,We know how he treats new routines,,so we know what we can come up against.,Anatoliy Nikolayevich,tells Vasiliy to do something.,And Vasiliy keeps walking,around the gym,,telling a story or something like that.,So, he says to me, ""Look, now,he's going to grumble for a while,,and then he's going to,come back and do it."",Again, there are nuances.,Then when he's done it, he turns,and says, ""Happy now? I did it."",He replies, ""Yes, I'm happy.,You're free to go now."",We sometimes predict,his reaction very precisely.,How he’s going to react, and we laugh.,Then, when we say it to him,,he says exactly the same.,And we’re like ― ha, ha!,And he’s like ― what’s up with you?,I ask him, why are you grumbling?,He says, well, I just grumble.,We just joke about it among ourselves.,But Vasiliy Anatolievich,is the way he is.,If he were different, he wouldn’t be the,Lomachenko that everyone knows so well.,After the workout, Vasiliy,goes to get some rest.,But Anatoliy Nikolayevich,continues to work.,He would make corrections into,the training schedule, if necessary.,Analyze the video. And definitely,come up with something new.,Vasiliy's father does not,work in boxing.,He lives boxing.,He teaches and learns.,He improves his athlete,and improves as a trainer.,Their tandem is a tandem of,two outstanding professionals.,And when Vasiliy goes,to get some relaxation,,Anatoliy Nikolayevich will analyze,the video of the latest workout.,Because he is the one who determines,what Vasiliy is going,to do the next day.,If the trainer says that something,has to be done in a certain way,,for example, you have to,run fast, and then slowly,,then slowly again, and then fast again.,Or, for instance, at five o'clock,in the morning,,you need to do fast training, not slow.,Or, you don’t get up at five,,but at six or seven.,Or, after one training session,,you have to do another one.,Or, instead of a two-hour session,,you need a three-hour one. And so on.,If the trainer says so,,this is what you must do,,this is the direction you must take.,The trust of Anatoliy Nikolayevich,to his trainee,and his son is the condition,upon which he can step,outside the boundary of,his previous experience.,Yes, it’s hard. You don’t know,how it’s going to turn out.,But if you trust me ― we’ll get there.,One step outside,the existing experience.,And that is how it goes -,every day, every hour, every minute...,One step beyond the boundary.,This is possible only on the condition,of total trust between,the trainer and the trainee.,Between the father and the son.,The space beyond the limit -,is where both Lomachenkos step together.,In professional boxing, there are,victories obtained outside the ring ―,but worth as much as,the titles and records.,Annually, the Boxing Writers,Association of America,determines the best of the best.,These are so-called Boxing Oscars,,which Lomachenko team members,now regularly receive.,For Vasiliy, getting various,awards is a usual thing.,But his father, who received the title of,the World's Best Trainer twice in a row,,felt ill at ease at the awards ceremony.,Great thanks to everyone for,acknowledging this achievement.,But first of all, I’d like to express my,gratitude to all the professional team,that works toward a common goal.,It’s our promoter Bob Arum,,the manager Egis Klimas,,our physical fitness trainer Cecilio,,the cutman Russ,,the psychologist Andrey Borisovich...,And of course, the talent, that shouldn’t,be impeded from realizing itself.,It doesn’t need to be helped,,just not impeded.,On the other hand, they say,,“The sportsman is the one who wins,,the trainer is the one who loses.”,So, in this case, what do we do?,The trainer stands aside,,and the sportsman wins.,So, thank you for winning!,I can say he's the best trainer,in the world!,And, of course, I'd like to believe,that it's the truth.,It isn't some kind of WOW for him,,""I'm the best trainer in the world!,And I got some award or other."",The fewer people talk about him,,the less they mention him,,the better he likes it.,He doesn’t worry about that.,He doesn't think about it at all.,He isn't vain, unlike me,,he doesn't need it.,He knows his worth, and he,doesn't care who says what.,Recognition or no recognition, all,the regalia do not bother him at all.,And he surely doesn't chase them,,unlike me.,He doesn’t like that.,But I will keep talking about it,because he’s done so much good,,and I will talk about it.,He may not talk about it, but I will.,Olexandr Usyk!,It was Anatoliy Nikolayevich,who accompanied Usyk,on his first fight as a pro.,He wanted to keep,working with Olexandr,but couldn't train him full-time,and on a regular basis.,Lomachenko focused on,working with his son.,Vasiliy and Olexandr often prepared,for their respective fights,simultaneously on different,points of the planet.,Usyk was, for a long time,,both successful and comfortable,working with his American trainer.,But Lomachenko was still,an unofficial mentor,,and the principal authority to him -,Anatoliy Nikolayevich stayed,in Olexandr's team,,always helped with timely advice...,and always rooted for Usyk,as if he were his own son.,Both Vasiliy and his father were,one step away from the ring,during Olexandr's first,championship match.,Three, Alex!,Circle around! From the right!,Left, then punish him!,Sock him from the right, come on!,Right-Left-Right! Three! Three!,Come on, come on!,In the autumn of 2016,,Usyk became World Champion.,After that, he has successfully,defended his title.,The opposition was growing stronger,,while the trainer situation -,if not exactly worse, then definitely,more complicated and confusing.,In the first three matches,after the title fight,,three different mentors,stood in Olexandrs' corner.,He kept looking for,the best one for himself.,Even knowing that it was useless.,An American trainer was replaced by,another American, then a Ukrainian one.,But not with the last name,that Usyk dreamed of.,Anatoliy Lomachenko still,attended Olexandr's fights,and supported him morally,and by giving advice.,While the boxer kept searching,for the best mentor,,knowing that he was very close,to the right one.,In the meantime, there was,a new challenge in store for Usyk,,the biggest in his career.,In case of his winning the world,boxing super series,,he would have become,the absolute world champion.,He had three matches to win. But all,the opponents were exclusively elite.,Usyk went into the final fight, but,the semi-final was extremely tough.,The experts said - specifically because,of the trainer. The clock was ticking.,The boxer realized that things,had to change - immediately.,He wanted to be trained by Lomachenko.,And he knew the other one,wouldn't mind anymore.,When Usyk voiced his request,,the trainer was ready for it.,It happened at Istanbul airport.,By that moment, when he only opened,his mouth when the offer was voiced,,We knew when and where we were going,and had already planned out our work.,The only thing - did he talk with you?,No. Neither did he talk with me.,And after that happened,,we agreed to meet in a week.,When I came to see him,in Belgorod-Dnestrovskiy,,he was very precise as for the place,where we would train.,Said that we needed a fully,private training base.,We prepared there in,a completely private mode.,The self-dedication,mode is tough to get used to.,Because you keep adding on, you keep,doing what you've never done before.,Why does one need to do that?,If you don't push your nervous,system to adapt to more,,you aren't allowing yourself,to go beyond the limit.,Your unconscious won't let you go there,,it will say ""no."",By pushing that limit,,you get permission -,we're going to go this far, we're,going to push a little further.,The first month of the training,session was extremely hard.,He had a hard time coping.,It was extreme.,It was very much,like what Vasya does now.,And it’s different from what,we did on the amateur level.,I saw what Sanya did.,It was hell, that’s how I’d put it.,Luckily, Sanya has a special quality.,Even if he's ""dying,"",quote-unquote, at work,,he accepts it personally - as a challenge.,There were situations when we said to,Sanya - that’s it, let’s do it tomorrow.,And we always ended up finishing,that “tomorrow” assignment,at three o’clock in the morning.,At three in the morning!,At two or three in the morning,,I wake up,and go downstairs from the second floor.,I’m surprised to see,Anatoliy Nikolayevich,and Andrey Borisovich sitting,there playing backgammon.,He asks me, ""Can't sleep?"" I say,,""No, just going to the toilet."",""Go sleep,"" he tells me.,I went to the loo, drank some water,,and went back to sleep.,In the morning, I started,asking questions:,I went downstairs at night,,and you guys weren't sleeping?,He says, ""Did you really?"",I have no idea why they weren't sleeping,at that time, playing backgammon.,Moscow was chosen as the place,for the final match -,even though Usyk's opponent was Russian.,He attended all the media,events with his mentor -,one of the most recognized trainers,in the world, Abel Sanchez.,Who was going to stand,in Olexandr's corner? -,It was a well-kept secret,until the very fight.,Before the fight, Usyk's,changing room was packed.,But Sanchez still managed to see his personal,rival in that fight among the crowd.,In the room's corner,modestly stood a man,whose name had already been,written into the history of boxing.,…still undefeated,and now the undisputed,cruiserweight champion of the world.,Olexandr Usyk!,He lives by the right values.,He lives by the orthodox faith.,He, in principle, keeps all,the basic commandments.,Maybe that’s why he became,more deeply religious with age.,His faith has become so strong,that it might be the reason,he stopped giving interviews.,Yes, he’s a believer.,And, in his faith, he’s directly,connected to God.,God cares most for what good things,you’ve done to people.,That’s why I think he’s directly,connected to Him.,Without taking into account of fights,the emotions of Anatoly Lomachenko,can be very rarely seeing.,And when they do appear on his face,,they are extremely positive.,A smile or laughing.,Even tears you’ve seen,appeared in his eyes,are of joy or fascination.,When Vasiliy had his birthday,,thirty years old,,he took the floor, and halted a little,,made a pause...,It was a charged silence.,If we didn’t know its contents,exactly, we could all feel it.,For thirty years, I have been,preparing for this.,God bless you, son.,I didn’t see the tears.,But the pause, I think, was because,he choked up with them.,But he, as always, stopped,at exactly the right moment.,Made a pause, then finished,and went back to his table.,Where are we here, Said?,We are at Staples Center, Los Angeles.,This is the locker room of the best,fighter of the world Mr.Lomachenko.,And we have a chance to have,Mr.Philipp Plein as the guest.,Thank you, guys.

,""God I always wanted,my kids to grow up,in Mad Max eating,lizards off the road,and murdering their neighbors,to get a glass of water."",I mean, things are,gonna break down.,Wesley,the passion that you,and so many others,have on us this,is what gives me,hope in democracy,and hope in the,future of the country.,That's what it's gonna,take to make change happen.,I think we're,living in a rigged system.,And I think it's very hard,to break out of that rigged,system because money talks.,- I drove down from San,Francisco yesterday on Highway Five,and it's bumper to bumper,for 300 miles on,Highway Five.,And you can think, God, that's,just a small part of it.,So we know in these,big urban areas,like the Los Angeles Basin,,metropolitan New York,,we know that, we live,here for convenience.,We live here because,civilization works,,but we also know it,is relatively fragile.,It depends on power,,it depends on water.,It depends on food, it,depends on warehousing.,It depends on security and,people following the rules,and obeying the laws.,And it only takes small,disruptions to that.,Whether through natural,disaster, through climate change,through organized,crime or through war,,through exogenous forces.,And you'd see catastrophe.,It's easy to,see how things can fall apart,,Long tunnels are now pitch dark.,Communications and telephone,systems have collapsed.,On motorways cars,simply pull over,,if they find a,place with a signal.,People now stand in line,outside supermarkets,,not to go in,,they're just hoping that,it will eventually open.,Combination of the weight,of scientific evidence.,And the dynamics of the,financial system suggest,that in the fullness of time,,climate change will threaten,financial resilience,and longer term prosperity.,All the money in the,world will not save us,once it starts to fail.,And then people will discover,that you can't eat,a flat screen TV,and you can't eat a,German luxury car.,What are we gonna do?,It's war.,And it's a much more serious,war than World War II,because if we lose,,we're all dead.,I mean, you'll already be dead.,So maybe it doesn't,concern you as much,but I don't want my,children to starve to death,You're writing me,off really early.,Please don't write me off,so early.,All right, 20 more years,Looks good doesn't it?,It does.,It's a great part of America.,It's like an American icon.,My generation was,the Beach Boys.,Yeah.,Surfing USA.,Yeah.,So, you know, tourist heaven.,Yeah.,But if I were a tourist,from another planet,and I was like, ""Hey,,let's go visit earth."",And then my travel guy was like,,""well it's populated,by about 10 billion carnivorous,apes and they're armed."",- My goal is to see...,- Let's give you 20 more year,Is to see your children,grown, educated, married,and I wanna have,great-grandchildren, that's my goal.,Okay, if you wanna,have great grandchildren,,what you have to do is,you have to help build,that environment that,they're gonna survive in.,I want you to see the,facts as they appear to me.,I'm a national security guy.,That's what I've spent,my life working on,trying to protect,America, the constitution,,the way we live and our futures,for our children,and grandchildren.,I love my dad we're both,concerned about security.,We're both concerned,about the future,but there's definitely,a difference,in the generational,perspective of this.,Now I understand his generation,because they grew up,,right after World War,II, the baby boomers.,They grew up in a world that,was constantly improving.,More rights, more money.,The economy constantly expanded.,They saw us go from fairly,primitive industrial society,to what we have today.,There've been empires,that formed and collapsed.,And about 200 years ago,,mankind suddenly discovered,how to take energy more,effectively from the earth.,In the start of,the industrial age.,And it was coal,and it was England.,And it was a steam engine,that could use that coal,and it spread throughout,the whole world.,We have taken that energy,and built this,civilization from it,and the price that's being paid,is the carbonization,of the atmosphere,and climate change.,Yeah, that's the finale.,You know, when you,say in World War II,,everybody chipped in,and did their part.,And that was,seventy-five years ago.,Now we've been involved,in so far, a 19 year war.,And in that 19 year war,,we were told to go shopping,and to buy more stuff.,We were never told,to save anything.,We were never told to,contribute to a war effort.,They even cut taxes,when we went to war,That's right, twice.,Twice.,With gambling, the house always,wins and it's a rigged game.,It just is.,Not unlike the banking system,in our political,system nowadays.,It's all rigged. People don't,have an actual,choice in a lot of stuff.,Yeah, people have a,choice to go to Vegas.,When you ran for president,,I drove all over New,Mexico and other places.,All I could think,in 2003 was that,,we can't actually,build an economy,off stripping, gambling,and crystal meth.,And we've made a concerted,effort to do that,in this country for,the last 20 years.,You know, our business,caters to what people want.,American societies produced,enormous amounts of leisure.,They've tried to recreate,the feel of the Roman Empire,in the heart of Vegas.,And interestingly it's,like late Roman Empire.,So it's right, as,everything collapsed.,We have the smarts,and the know-how,and the conscience to know,we have to sustain,and protect this earth,because this is where we live.,So we love civilization,,but we've got to change,the way we're approaching,our economic endeavors.,The world is suffering,through the worst financial,crisis since 1930s.,There's been a,lot of damage done.,They hear $700,billion package,,and they immediately,think the next day,everything is gonna be better.,You're witnessing,so much wealth loss.,If you connect,the financial system,to the other possible,shocks that are out there,,you realize it's,,we're walking on ice.,Panic coming,through the phones,,on the floor, traders,just trying to rush,to get to the point of sale,,to get rid of their stock.,You know,,what people built up,over years and years and,years, has been erased.,At some point, you run a,risk that something goes afoul.,We're worried about Greek debt.,We're worried,about Italian debt.,Spanish debt.,I mean and so far, you,know, it's been finessed,,but, and you know,,you can't see what the U.S,Treasury is doing behind.,We're doing a lot with,the U.S Government,to keep the system working.,And you just don't know,what the limits are.,So if you think,,how can we lead the world,in fixing the economy,and fixing the climate?,You have to make,the investments now.,Because you can't wait,till you're like Somalia.,I mean, you may notice,Somalia doesn't have a lot,of infrastructure programs,that they fund.,They're not pushing the,boundaries in technology,,and that's not because,people in Somalia are stupid,,it's not just because they've,lived under civil war,,it's because they,don't have capital.,They don't have resources.,Capitalism is an,economic organization.,It's a way of,organizing the economy,that is focused on trying,to create future returns,over and above of the,investments I make today.,So it's all about expansion.,It's all about making,more in the future,than we currently have.,When you borrow money,,well, what happens is,,the banks would like,to charge you interest,not only for the risk,,but because they want the,capital to come back with babies,,not just to go and that's it.,Because they want to make sure,that capital is increasing,and that's how you build wealth,and that's how you,increase your assets.,And it's that debt,that has enabled,all of this to be here.,It's the accelerant,to economic growth.,Now, as long as the company,can service that,debt, it's okay.,But consumer debt,,if it can't be,serviced, is a problem.,Mortgage debt if it,can't be serviced,,as we've seen is a problem,,and national debt, if,it can't be serviced,,can be a national,security threat.,Alexa, how do we avert,a financial crisis?,Here's something,I found on Wikipedia.,A financial crisis is any of,a broad variety of situations,in which some financial assets,suddenly lose a large part,of their nominal value.,Preparing for the future,,when the future is unknown,,is obviously difficult,,but we are today taking steps,that are clearly going,to make things worse.,Finance is really,making big bets,on an uncertain future.,And you wanna be careful,about making too many bets,,especially when there,is some indication,that the future might be very,different from the present.,So much,of our energy's caught up,in the financial system,that we've neglected the,investment in real things,that are required to,take the country forward.,We do, we haven't really,come to grip with this yet,,because the economic system,,the political system just,doesn't wanna face it.,The economy has grown,,but debts, indebtedness,of households,,firms, banks, governments,,the debts of all these,actors in economic system,have increased,much more than GDP.,Really?,Yeah. So let's say,,I think maybe in,the 1970s or so the,,total debt of all these actors,,households, firms, banks,,government, the total debt,to GDP ratio was maybe of,,of the order 120%.,And now that has,increased very steadily,over time to about 290%. So...,So if no one got,paid for three years,and continued working,the whole time.,Exactly. Yup, yup.,And didn't eat or,drive cars or anything,,we could pay that debt?,Yeah. Yeah.,But does the debt matter?,Well, I mean, the,debt matters to some,,to the extent that,we have a system,,it is called capitalism.,And in that system,,laws are telling us that,debts have to be repaid.,How much debt do we need,to generate $1 of GDP?,For the economy to create,one extra dollar of income,,we need, we are relying,on $3.30 of extra debt.,An income is basically,wages plus profits.,That is what GDP is, you can,also call it differently.,You can say it is value added,,created by producing stuff.,And as a result of,emphasizing on the GDP,,we've ended up in a situation,where the market is going on.,There is some selling,,there is some buying,,but we really don't know,how well people are doing.,You know, when,we were kids, $1 of debt,,pretty much created $1 of GDP.,Oh wow.,So, you know, it's,like Keynesian economics,,you put the money,into social projects,and it recycles back,into the economy.,But today it takes,more than $3 of debt,to produce $1 of GDP.,And that's all occurred,in the last like 30 years.,Wow.,So in order to,create more money,,you've gotta create more debt.,Three times as much debt.,That's insane.,More than three,times as much debt.,It's that access to,credit and the kind of ability,to take on lots and lots of,debt that hasn't been able,to sustain this kind of,trend in consumption.,So there is a very,,very strong relationship,between increases in income,and increases in,carbon emissions.,In the U.S, which is,already kind of the most,disproportionately,high energy producing,,high consuming country per,capita spending grew 42%,overall from 1990 to 2008.,With a 300% increase in,spending on furniture,,an 80% increase on clothing,and a 15 to 20% increase,on vehicles, housing and food.,Despite the fact that,wages were pretty stagnant,over that time period.,So this is the,Wall Street Bull,,which is a symbol of,a positive market,,which means more people,are spending money,,than spent it the day before.,Our democracies basically,have become dependent,on the idea that there will,always be more to go around,that we can expand,,expand, expand.,We know that there's,fundamental uncertainty.,We just don't know what,the future will hold.,Over the course of my career,,I've worked in,mathematical modeling.,I was a space physicist for NASA,and I was on pretty,big projects.,I was on the Hubble Space,Telescope team as a scientist.,I was on mission to Mars,as a space physicist.,And so I'd worked on in,some pretty big areas.,When people say, well,,how do you know that the,climate models that we have now,will be accurate,in 30 years time?,What I can tell you is that,the models that we were working,on 30 years ago are actually,unbelievably accurate.,What's happened,with the atmosphere,,is we're seeing this type of,instability, kind of like,,you know, if you had a,top just standing there,,it'll just fall over.,And so you're,seeing that type of,,that type of wobbling,and instability.,I don't exactly know how,unstable things are going to be,,but to me, it's the,volatility and the instability,that's even more,concerning than just,the pure temperature,rise over time.,Let's say that inflation,were to go over the top,,stock market crashes.,Let's say there are all kinds,of sanctions on exports.,You can't even export your tech.,You know, all you're left with,,to survive is you,and your environment.,You know, one of my goals,this year was actually,to get more educated,on climate change.,And I took the path,that I was gonna see both,sides of the argument.,And what was interesting,to me was I could find,very little in the,climate denial space.,The more I read, the,more I see around me,,the more I get concerned.,The officials,came out and said,,we're gonna have to,release the dams.,And I remember,looking at my husband,and looking at my daughter,and the dog and the house,and thinking, am I in,the middle of some movie?,So I'm 5.8.,And the water reached,to about right there.,Until it happens,to you, you don't,,you don't believe,that this can happen,in the United States of America.,And all of your financial,stability is gone.,So if we have, God forbid,,any other emergency that,comes up and believe me,,that is a source of a,traumatic kind of panic,that sets in when we go, Oh,,you know, what if,something happens,,what if there's,another emergency that,,that arises, then,we have no funds.,Never did I ever,imagine that everything,that I would work so,hard for would be taken,from me in a matter of hours.,And so I do believe,that climate change,is going to have a,huge economic impact.,And what wealth you,have can be eradicated,in a matter of hours.,We had a house,up here on the hill,that my wife wanted,to get out of,because it was dangerous,for the fires, you know.,Yeah.,And the climate change,,everything's getting crispy,,so we'd better get,,to somewhere where we're,not gonna get burned up.,Yeah.,So we moved to,this beautiful place,and the fire didn't get us.,But the debris flow after,the fire wiped us out, man.,We had like mud four,feet here, huge rocks.,You were here, right?,- Oh we were.,- How did you get out?,Rescued by helicopter man.,Jesus.,I said, you know, I said,,my wife, we, you got a sheet?,And she said, yeah.,I said, what are you,gonna do with the sheets?,I said, I'm gonna write,,help out there, you know.,She said maybe make it SOS,,I say that's a good idea.,Went out there and,drew SOS, in the mud.,And pretty soon,,They come, they let a,guy down, and they said,,we weren't sure if it was,a SOS or an area code,,it looked like it,could have been 805.,And I said, well I gotta,work on my esses man.,But we were lucky, you,know, we could afford to...,Well people died, people,died in this, right?,Oh! Terrible, people were,washed right through our place.,And we were the lucky ones.,You know, we had the money,,to refurbish this place.,I know, yeah.,But you know, imagine,,people, you know, struggling,all over the world,with this climate change.,That's the way It starts,it's, you read about it,and It seems far away.,But then something happens,and bang it's right on you,- and it gets very personal.,- That's right.,Hey, I hope you went,quick, that's all I can say.,I hope you went quick.,Oh my gosh.,Words can't describe it.,Words can't describe it.,Global systems of finance,are deeply connected,and based on housing finance,in places like,the United States.,So if you get in a,situation where a homeowner,,can't, can't pay an,insurance premium,,can't hold on to their,mortgage, for that reason.,Defaults on a mortgage,,goes into foreclosure.,You have kind of, your,setting in motion,,the sort of early,parts of the story,that we know is a very familiar,one from 2007 and 2008.,And we're not,particularly good,,at preparing for difficult,times way in the future,,when in fact we've got,difficult choices right now.,When you survey,people in the U.S,and in the UK about sources of,stress, it's work and money.,Alexa, how do I solve,our economic problems?,Sorry,,I don't know that.,We're heading off the cliff,,in terms of climate change.,There's a real urgency on this,now that cannot be denied.,I grew up in the heart of the,military industrial complex.,My father became a general,,after I went off to college.,I went to the foreign,service school at Georgetown.,Madeleine Albright was one,of my advisors in college,and I thought, I know,how the world works.,There are people in charge.,There's some with a plan.,There's someone running stuff.,When my father was head of,NATO and I got to go over there,and visit and hear the kind,of questions that senators,and congressmen,were coming up with.,I realized, whoa, no,one's running anything.,And the mistake that the,great majority of us make,,is that, there are groups,of people running things.,Someone has a master,plan, there's a cabal,or a conspiracy behind,it all that's running it.,And it's just not the case.,Hey Wes.,How was the conference?,Good.,Good.,No, I think,,well I think they,,I think they really wanted,to hear what's going on,and what the challenges are.,Yeah.,And that's what I gave them.,Kind of reading this thing,about Venezuela you see.,What happens when an,economy collapses.,Total collapse.,I mean, is it, was it just,initially the oil prices or...,They've tried to make,it a populist democracy.,You know, where now,Maduro is, is a dictator,,but you know, supposedly,people like him,,but in an actual,fact Cuba's in there.,And I was down about six,months ago in Colombia.,And they were telling,me that actually,,the Cubans are going up,to the Venezuelan army,and they're disarming them,,because they don't,trust the Venezuelan.,This is the way you,take over a country.,You're getting rid of,,you know, you put your,security forces in,,and then you build up,your extra military force.,And then you go to the military,that might be loyal,to the country,and say, give us your weapons.,So a lot of Venezuelan,militaries become refugees.,Oh wow.,They were disarmed and sent,out of the country, yeah.,And there's millions of,people that are just there.,They lived there,,they were born there,and they're,struggling to survive.,It's a, I mean, we're heading,in that direction already,,before we've even had,the economic breakdown.,With armed groups,in the streets.,You had 20,000 armed people,in the streets yesterday.,Well that was just,a demonstration.,Brought guns, you don't,bring guns to a demonstration,,unless you're demonstrating,you'd like to kill people,that don't agree with you.,Venezuela can be an,example of what happens,when civil society breaks down,because you don't have stable,,transparent rule,of law government,,and you don't invest in your,infrastructure the right way.,In many ways, Venezuela,is a leading indicator,of the challenges that,will face the whole world.,Many like Erin,Burgos feel they have no choice.,What was once one of Latin,America's wealthiest countries,,is now its most,chaotic and dangerous.,But that's what happens,in these countries.,But by these countries,,you mean countries,that have incompetent,leadership.,Countries that are failing,to take care of their people.,But they compensate for that by,,setting up repressive,mechanisms,,to ensure that they,stay in power.,I just worry about it,happening in the United States.,We have a country like,Venezuela where the first thing,that collapsed is their,energy infrastructure.,- Yeah.,- And then now we're finding out,that it's not just electrical,and oil pumping now their water,infrastructure is collapsing,and this is a country,that's tropical,,that's filled with water.,The energy sector has,not received the training,or investment it needs, and,the experts were kicked out.,They said the energy sector,in particular the oil,sector is collapsing.,And that was a major source,of revenue for the country.,At the same time, you have,significant drought in a country,that has a lot of water,,which means the,dams cannot produce,the same electricity,as they used to.,So you have collapse of,the electrical sector,,along with the oil sector,,along with civil society.,And this means you also have,collapsing water infrastructure,,because even if,you have the pipes,,if you don't have electricity,,you can't operate everything.,So severe strain, which,means food shortages,,riots, lack of money,,this is a major problem.,United States and,Europe is rich,,but if we choose to under,invest in our infrastructure,and if we choose to not,prepare for the future,,we could suffer these,kinda consequences as well.,The impact of climate change,is not a straight line function.,It's clearly,a progression that,is accelerating,in magnitude very dramatically.,And so any lapse at,this point in responding,is going to have, I,think, a critical impact,down the road, much sooner,than we would anticipate.,This is a crisis,waiting to happen.,It's a slow moving crisis,in front of our eyes.,So when you see in a movie,,an asteroid's gonna,hit us in six months,,but Mr. President,we've been working,on this potential,problem for six years.,In real life the asteroid,takes everybody out.,The same goes for,climate change.,The same goes for a whole,host of issues we have,because when people,see something on TV,and look, politics,is a confidence game.,When people look at the,politician and they go,,he must know what,he's talking about,or she must know what,she's talking about.,That doesn't mean there's,an actual plan with any kind,of systemic machinery behind,it to produce results.,As the water start to recede,the financial costs will add up.,Are you tired of living,in a home like this,when you really wanna be,living in a home like this?,Let's check it out.,We've got tons of,waterfront property,,and more coming every day.,Century 22 now serving,parts of California.,♪ Best sparkling,drinks are just dandy ♪,♪ The cho...,For those of you that,went to the mountain,and enjoyed that 16 feet,of brand new, fresh powder,,nice job.,But as you can see, we've,got a hot front coming in,,so tomorrow there's gonna,be 155 degrees Fahrenheit.,So you might wanna,break out those Speedos.,You read the big,article about Peter Teal,,who's the guy who's made,the big fortune off tech,,has bought and built bunkers,in New Zealand, right?,Because their plan is,we're all gonna die,,and then they're gonna,ride it out somehow,even though they won't.,But there's the belief that,their money will insulate,and shelter them,from what's coming,and for all these people...,For climate change,Who predicted doomsday.,Yeah I mean, I've,heard, you know,,I've heard climate change,likened to a world war.,You know, the difference,is that we know a lot more,about what's coming.,Come on down to our,luxury survival condo,and don't let the,Armageddon get you down.,So unless you can,produce thousands of years,worth of water and air and food,in your underground bunker,,you're not gonna make it.,And the most likely,outcome will be that,the construction workers,probably non-union,that you paid to build,this bunker for you,know exactly where it is.,And they have access to all,the tools to dig you out of it,like a truffle.,The sooner people start,using their money as a tool,,instead of a goal in life,,the faster we're gonna,be able to dig ourselves,out of this hole.,Okay, so dad, we've,,I know you don't,wanna pay attention,- and you don't wanna be...,- I do.,Filmed with miniatures,,because it could, you know,,you don't wanna look like,the guy in Dr. Strange Love,or any other...,Exactly.,Retired General,playing with things...,That's exactly,what it looks like.,But, look, we need,to set up something,that people can,understand how it works.,We have like a grocery,farmer, another store here,a bank, a homeowner, and,then emergency services,and over here's like nature,,or we'll even say,foreign country,or Africa, or somewhere else.,So, but the first thing,I gotta do is change,how everything's set up,,because we need the bank,in between,the country club,and everybody else.,We have a huge financial,system compared to what the,,what I can call the real economy,that is where people work,and produce, and live.,What we were talking,about was trying to explain,capital, structures,and insurance,and financing and mortgages,using children's toys.,So we have money...,Is it gonna work?,I don't know if it's,gonna work.,First thing is, the,grocery store is a business,and it makes money,,and they deposit the,money in the bank.,Okay. Boom.,Okay?,John works at the grocery store,and he gets paid by,the grocery store,and he decides he,wants to buy a house.,Okay.,He doesn't have enough,money from his earnings,to buy a house, but he goes,to the bank and the bank said,,""Oh we'll give you the,money, to buy the house,,and in return, you'll,give us an IOU."",We have to look at the house,is it, does it pass inspection?,Yeah, pass inspection.,And can you afford it,based on your monthly income?,Well,,The answer, say yes.,- Yes.,- Okay, good.,So here's a mortgage.,Okay, so here's the money and...,And by the way, this is just,like a real bank,,because in the real bank,,they're not sure can,this guy pay for it?,Just tell him yes, tell,him yes, come on,,- lets get the money.,- So it depends on paying.,We typically think that,bank takes deposits from us,and then lends it out.,The balance sheet equates,one entry on this side,,another entry on that side, has,sort of claims to come back,,and if it's really,comes back as expected,,they make a return on that.,And it's basically making,money out of thin air.,In the old days,,I would put this,mortgage, and I would say,,""This is an asset for me,,""because you're gonna,pay me every month,""to pay this,mortgage off,"" right?,So you're telling all,your buddies you had that.,Well, I found a better,way to make money, okay?,So the bank takes the IOU,,and the bank sells the IOU,into the what's called,the secondary market.,- Okay.,And it gets a fee for that.,Then once I have this,mortgage and maybe the mortgage,for many other houses,in the neighborhood,,and ideally from other,neighborhoods as well,,I throw this into what we call,a special purpose vehicle,,which really, in legal,terms, is typically a trust,or a corporation, these,assets-shielding devices,,and then you issue claims,against these new legal,shells to investors.,They package these IOUs,up so there's many of them,,and they sell them to people,like insurance companies,or foreign banks, and,they can be leveraged.,Which means I can make,loans off these things,,which are loans.,Yes, because you,have leverage here.,So you can make more loans.,So the system always,generates cash.,They can reduce their risk,because they're not,just buying a mortgage,,they're buying a,package of mortgages.,In some cases, they're,just buying a slice,of the interest rate off,a package of mortgages.,And so, all of these,are called derivatives.,And everything works, as long,as there's an expectation,that the loan will be repaid,,that John will, at the,right time each month,,give the bank money to pay,down his share of the IOU.,So the old way the,banking system worked,,it used to work that the banker,would look you in the eye,and say, ""Are you credit worthy?"",""Can I trust you?"",The banks really,aren't keeping,the mortgages on,their books anymore.,They're selling those mortgages,so that they can be repackaged,as other kinds of,financial instruments.,So, they're able to,sort of pass the buck,,pass the risk off,to the next person.,Depending on how they're,rated by the rating agencies,,these are reputable,investment opportunities,for retirement funds, sure.,Yeah, pension funds,,sure, put 'em in here.,So the investors,are buying an interest,in the cashflow that,comes from the homeowners,into the pool that,we've created,,but have sort of a claim,against this house as well,because this cashflow is backed,by the mortgage,against the home.,So something as,illiquid, as formidable,as this building and,the land it stands on,can become a globally,tradable financial asset,through appropriate,legal coding.,This is your loan.,It travels through this system.,The bank has the loan,,Sells it, it becomes a security.,It becomes part of,the balance sheet,of money market mutual funds.,These money market mutual,funds then basically exchange,your loan, your,collateral, your house,in a collateralized cash,deal, and the whole purpose,of both the cash and the,collateralized cash deal,is that it allows,the various actors,to operate in derivative markets,and make very high rates,of short-term return.,Today, debt is,treated like an asset.,It can be traded,globally, right?,So we made a huge jump from,let's say the 12th century,when the first assignable,notes came about,,to treating debt as an asset,that we can just trade,on a global market.,At the bottom,,there's tangible value.,The same value is used, not,just one time, but two or three,or four times in the,financial sector trading.,It is not going for productive,investment in firms.,It is also not going,to finance and fund,climate change mitigation,and de-carbonization.,Money creates more money.,Wealth creates more wealth.,And this is a circle,,and it just rolls on.,At the end of the,day, it's our houses,,the value of our houses,,which are backing this up.,The IMF has called it ""the,shadow banking system."",""Shadow"" here doesn't,mean that it is illegal.,It also doesn't mean that it,is necessarily shady and so on.,It is just that it is shadow,because there are no rules.,It's hardly any rules.,It's sort of almost the Wild,West of the financial sector,And a problem with,the derivative market,is there is no market.,So it's like one-on-one,swaps between bankers.,It's like you and I say,,""Hey, I know what bank,you're working for,,""and so I've got some bonds,,""and I want you to,insure 'em for me,""in case the interest,rate changes.,""Would you insure,these bonds for me?"",""How much would you charge?"",You tell me a price.,I say, ""That's a good deal."",""I'll get a bonus for,setting up the insurance.,""You'll get a bonus"",""for taking in the money,to do the insurance."",But I work at,a different bank.,It's a good deal.,And I heard you,just bought those.,And I figure I could,also get those,,'cause I know a guy in,Saudi Arabia or China,that would pay two cents more,,and I could make,50 grand off it.,You wind up so far,from the underlying.,The thing is, it's like the,old insurance principle, it's,""How many people can insure,one person's house""?,Can each person in the,neighborhood put a $100,000 policy,on that house and each,person collect $100,000,when the $100,000,house burns down?,As Americans,,we're shortsighted,,and we don't think long-term,and financial literacy,was not this complicated,100 years ago. You had,a little bit of money,,and probably didn't even,have a bank account.,You paid your bills, and,you passed bills around.,And you kept it,under the mattress.,Right, or you kept,it under the mattress.,Shh, that's not where mine's at.,The critical derivatives for,our financial markets today,are actually the ones that,brought down the financial system,in 2008 were the,credit default swaps,and the collateralized,debt obligations.,And the credit default,swap is basically,a kind of an insurance contract,,which basically says, ""If,some assets in the markets"",""decline in value, the,insurer has to pay me a fee."",And the beauty of the CDS,,the credit default swap,,was that you didn't have,to hold the asset yourself.,It's like me taking out,a fire insurance on,my neighbor's house,,and if that house burns,down, I get the premium.,The value of these,financial transactions,is much, much larger than,the tangible, real capital,,which is basically the,houses of the families,,the households,,the notional value,of the derivative,market is $600 trillion.,And that is about let's say,,eight to 10 times as,large as global GDP.,So an American city with,how many trillions of dollars,of real estate,value right there,,or at least hundreds,of billions,,will no longer be there.,Like, how does that work?,How does that work in,the banking sector?,How does that work in,the insurance market,,the re-insurance market,,what's been collateralized,off that real estate?,This is not just,different actors,,exchanging in different markets,or in different,legal transactions,,our financial system is such,that we have huge banks,,mega banks, too,big to fail banks,,very often operating both,sides of the same market.,The big banks, they don't,necessarily know how much risk,their counterparty bank,in some other country,- is willing to undertake.,- No one really,understands the legal,interdependencies,that are built into,these contracts,,and that can,ultimately bring down,the entire financial system.,The system is so complicated,that the accountability is lost.,So the real value,is actually here.,These are all the transactions,which are built on top,of the real economy.,Then there's Dougherty.,The small town of,Dougherty is not,,not a whole lot there today.,Just it was a town that,once had a general store,when I was growing,up, had the church,,had a post office, but,you know, not anymore.,Agriculture and rural,America has gotten a preview,of the automation,that's about to hit,the rest of the country,in the next 10 years.,We're here at the town,square in Dewitt, Arkansas.,And if you look around, I mean,there's not a ton of,bustling businesses here,,but one of the,busiest businesses,is Department of Human Services.,So when we define the real,economy, let's not forget farms.,88% are still,small family farms.,So this is a grain storage bin,on my parents' family farm.,This is my dad's place.,He's gonna be 87, mom's 85.,They've lived here since 1956.,So, a lot of years.,And we are a team.,How many times you have,to have intense rains,,heat spells, freezings at the,wrong point to get the crops,to not come in once?,We do protect our farmers,,we give them crop insurance,and the crop insurance,is subsidized.,We have agricultural,extension services,,and they pay for that, but,they probably don't pay,the full cost of that.,It's a free market economy but,,it's also a national,security issue.,Federal crop insurance program,was started as a,response to the effects,of the dust bowl and,the Great Depression.,Many, many areas throughout,the United States were,,were severely affected,by the Dust Bowl,,many farmers lost everything.,In addition to most of America,being devastated,by the depression,,farmers acutely suffered,during that time.,Many parts of the plains,were just completely,filled with dust.,Many crops were lost,due to the weather,,the extreme weather,,due to insects.,But it's the large,scale like my dad said,,the large scale events that,everybody kinda worries about,,like a big drought.,I think that our,aquifer in some places,is down to like 20% and,then a lot of places at 50%,,and we're actually,using more water than,we have at any other time.,We have our pumping plants in,and we're building on canals,and this is actually,the first phase.,We're trying to get water,to this, this Indian bio,and then we're gonna use that,for the main water supply.,In Arkansas, we're gonna,have a drought event,,every growing season.,It doesn't matter,,if we just came,like this last flood,that we had here,,as soon as we came out,of that flood event,,we were irrigating because our,soil is, it's not real deep.,We have what they call a,hard pan underneath it,,pretty close to the surface,Which helps with,the rice growing.,Yes, very helpful.,It just gets more,expensive every day.,We thought we were gonna have,a lot of infrastructure,money maybe to come about,,but it hasn't come about.,And its federal infrastructure,money that coming?,Well, the way that was,originally set up was that,,the federal government was,gonna be responsible for 65%,the state 10, and our,local district, 25.,And there's a lot of,people benefit from this,other than just the farmers,,but that's, who's,got to pay for it,'cause those are only the ones,that's actually using the water.,And I'm assuming,we'll have to do,a whole bunch of,stuff like that.,As temperature rises and,rain patterns change.,When every person we've,talked to about farming,and different methods of farming,whether it's till or no,till or organic or not.,Each piece of land is different.,And each little,community is different.,And the ecosystem,there is different.,So how can a giant JP Morgan,,how can they service,a community like this?,- Well, and why would they want to?,- Yeah.,That's the rest of the story.,I mean, that's not,gonna be a profit center,for them to come out,here and look at a man,that's farming,2,000, 3,000 acres.,They're looking for,20, 50,000 acre farms,to where they can justify,spending some time on them.,The relationships with the,banks they've gotten big too.,But it used to be,these smaller banks,and they knew your,dad and his dad.,If you went to a farm sale and,""Hey I liked this tractor."",And it was $27,000.,You just call the bank,and say, ""Hey, I need it."",""Okay, it's in your account."",60 years ago if you made a,crop, you made money period.,If you made a crop,,you paid all your bills,and you could send,your kids to school,and you buy your groceries.,You were okay.,Today, you can make a,crop and lose your assets.,Everybody out here,,it's all family and,,I mean, if you were 30,years ago when we did this,we get all, a,combine was $35,000.,And now a combine is $400,000.,When you're looking,at machines that,,so by the time you,have your headers,and your everything,to go with it,being upward close to,half a million dollars.,Where else is,someone else buying,half a million dollar equipment,and I'm barely making ends meet.,It gets more,challenging every year.,The cost of production,and agricultural costs,or just to be a farmer,and even a small farmer,are almost cost prohibitive,unless your family has been,in farming for generations.,Thank God almighty for,such a good looking crop,while others have,had to struggle.,Oh, here's some fellows.,Yeah, that's who,we're riding with.,Y'all be riding with him.,Alright, thanks Zach.,See you there.,Farms are similar,to owning a house.,You've gotta clean the gutters.,You've gotta sweep the sidewalk.,And the same thing with a farm,you've got certain maintenance,that have to be done,on annual basis to keep,it in a working order.,Before automation, everything,in here is handwritten.,24th, 1955.,Yep. And everyday...,And that's everything that,happened during that day,all the money that came in.,They made four loans.,Like this is, these are the,loans that we made that day.,And you see the size of,the loans; $150, $500.,The countryside across America,not just in our rural community,but other rural communities,used to have a lot of,small community banks,that were very plugged,into their communities,and to the people,that live there.,And trying to help them,grow their businesses,and their lives.,So just afraid of what the,landscape holds going forward.,You're just a number,,you're CUSIP number,on a bond security,and here's where you,mail your check now.,It's getting harder and,harder for those farmers,to stay in business because,they cannot get the funding.,Because with each year,of them incurring loss,and then no hope of...,The prices don't get,better the next year,regardless of the type,of natural disasters,and things that happen.,And so the farmer gets,further and further behind,and we've had several,farmers that are actually,going out of business.,They're having to,sell their equipment,and turn the farm over,to someone else to farm.,It's actually something,that I have no control over.,And none of us around,in England, Arkansas,have any control over.,And at the last,one, like in 2008,when they were saying that,,""The banks wouldn't have money,to loan to your farmers."",And I had several,farmers that were just,pulling their hair out.,They were just, ""Are you,gonna be able to loan me,enough money to,finish this crop?"",And I finally told him,,""Just go home and,watch Andy Griffith,and quit watching CNN and Fox."",And said, ""You know,,as far as I know"",we're gonna have the money and,we're gonna take care of you,""and you need to quit,watching all of those..."",Stuff to scare you.,Yeah. That you,have no control over.,So a couple of weeks later,,he came back and said,,""You know that was,the best advice,I've gotten so far this year."",The rainfall amounts, we,don't get an inch anymore.,It's either three,inches or nothing.,Everything is extremes.,Many of those restrictions,on banks are being peeled back.,So we still have,trading in derivatives.,It's not, we don't,know what it is.,There's hundreds of,trillions of dollars,maybe 600, maybe 800 trillions,of dollars of derivatives,on currency exchanges,that can't be covered.,It's like after 1980s it was,,""Oh, Gordon Gekko,is a great guy.,He taught us greed is good."",Look what it's gotten us.,It's a cycle in America.,You have to create wealth.,You can't create wealth,by just taking it from,other people through taxes.,People have to be,incentivized to create wealth.,And this has been the great-,Okay, but wait a minute,This has been,the great virtues,of Western democracy,for 300 years...,But it's also been the,massively misunderstood.,So go back to the,post-civil war United States,and the growth.,The growth was made off land,that people were literally,killed and chased off of,and they're like, ""Hey man,,look at all this free land."",And that's how money was made.,You have to resolve that we,can do better going forward.,American capitalism can,be pretty heartless.,If you look back at,the American Civil War,and what happened,right afterwards,,we industrialized America,,we went into the Gilded Age.,People look at these,""robber barons"" and said,,""This can't last."",And we ended up in the,progressive movement.,This is the age of Reagan.,The Reagan era,was the relaxation,of the administrative state.,It was the sort of, let,big firms get bigger.,It's let's make money.,Let's do it all with money.,Let's let charities,take care of people.,Forget about,government programs.,And that's run since,Reagan was elected.,Thank you very much.,I was raised red.,I was raised in a red family.,I grew up in the '80s.,Fell in love with Ronald Reagan.,I idolized Reagan.,I saw Reagan and I,said, ""I want his job."",In fact, my parents told me,I mailed him a dollar bill.,I defaced the dollar bill,with my picture on it.,The maxim is,,Doveryai, no proveryai,trust but verify.,You repeat,that at every meeting.,But I wanted to,be in politics.,I wanted to be the first woman,,president of United States.,I thought it was fascinating.,We can leave our children,with an unrepayable, massive,debt and shattered economy,or we can leave them liberty,in a land where every individual,has the opportunity to be,whatever God intended us to be.,People like to say,economics is a science,but it really follows politics.,Keynes came out and looked at,it, he saw the political need.,That's how we understood,macroeconomics.,Friedman came out,and looked at it,and he saw deficit spending,and he saw government control,and he saw high taxes,,and he said, there has,to be a better way.,He reinvented,classical economics.,They called it,Neoliberal Economics.,Quoted Milton,Friedman and said that,,that how the economy,of the United States,oughta be judged by the,number of imports that we have,and not exports.,And I thought maybe this,was a typo or something.,And so I asked him, I said,,""I mean, are you for real?"",Trickle-down economics,starts in 1980.,It's right around in there.,Late '70s, we get into it.,But the bottom line is,,has two parts to it.,First fire the cops.,Not the cops on Main Street,,the cops on Wall Street.,Turn them loose.,Let those banks do,whatever they wanna do.,And so here we are now, 40,years into the age of Reagan,and people are looking,at what it's done, okay.,It's made a lot of,people really wealthy.,We won the Cold War,during that period.,Not necessarily because of,that, but we won the Cold War.,And America became,this supreme power.,But for the people of America,,it hasn't been so good.,I know, their real,wages went down.,Real wages went down and,people in this country look back,and they wanna make America,as great as it was in the 1950s.,That's when the marginal,tax rate was 91%.,I know.,Ronald Reagan, my,mother loved him.,She watched him every,Sunday night on GE Theater.,At the end, he would say,,""At General Electric,,progress is our most,important product."",What would,wrong Reagan say,,if you told him that GE spends,more money on stock buybacks,than it does on R&D?,In 1950, stock,buybacks were illegal.,They were considered,market manipulation.,Now, investment analysts,look at that company and say,""A lot of companies,are really smart.,I think their stocks,gonna continue to grow up,because they've got a really,great stock buyback program."",It does nothing for the economy.,The average American is...,they're living in,the GDP of 1980.,Yeah.,I mean, yeah, clearly,the world has changed,,and the commodities you can buy,are not the same commodities,,but in terms of your,let's say average,to the extent that we can,measure living standards,,living standards,have not improved.,Firms finance their investment,out of their profits,,that's what people think.,Now, if you look at the 500,biggest U.S corporations,,50% of the profits,are paid as dividends,,50% of the profits are,useful buying back stocks.,All the profits,dissipate, are gone.,So how do they finance,their investment?,If they...,Debt!,Debt.,The president,expressed surprise,about the collapse on,the markets yesterday.,He's still enduring popularity,as much to the economic boom,that America has enjoyed,under his leadership.,More people are working,than ever before in history,where our productivity is up,so is our manufacturing,product up.,There is no runaway inflation,as there has been in the past.,So as I say, I don't,think anyone should panic,because all the economic,indicators are solid.,But the warning,signs have long been there,in the closed factories in,many American small towns.,I mean, there is this notion,of billionaires,creating employment,,and that is,trickle-down economics.,The problem about that,is that in history,,it has never happened.,There is no such thing as,trickle-down economics.,It simply doesn't exist.,It really,is voodoo economics.,When you put the smartest,people in the world in finance,which is what we've done,for the last 25 years,in this country,,you can't hold back their,imagination and their creativity.,The speed and scale of,global economic change,has overwhelmed the,national systems,of rules and regulations.,So our first test,is to agree tougher,and more transparent supervision,of banks, hedge funds,and what is known as the,global shadow banking system.,And so when you,get right down to it,,I'm a licensed banker.,And so when the regulators,come to my bank,,we're very simple little bank.,They look for the SOP,,they look for due diligence,on projects we've done.,It's pretty easy.,You go to a big bank, Wells,or JP Morgan or Goldman,,and you're a regular like,,""What is this? I see these,emails and..."" I mean,,they don't understand it because,they're not working in it.,They didn't invent it.,- Sure.,- It's like trying to teach people,a theory of quantum gravity,when they've had a high,school physics course,and they're inspecting,Stephen Hawking or something.,The earth is,like a bounded natural system,that can't expand forever.,The beauty of the legal code,and derivatives are a,product of the legal code,is that we can expand it,how far we want, right?,So we always create,new types of assets,,we create new types of,legal tricks in the end,,and the two systems are,not easily compatible.,If you're very rich and,you gamble with your money,and you lose it in Las Vegas,,that is what you want,and it's your problem.,But here, if they lose their,money here, it is our problem.,The market can't punish,for things it doesn't,know anything about.,And they haven't,factored any of the risks,that all this could change.,Natural disaster could,have major repercussions,for our financial system,,just because they will have,an effect on the asset values.,The new law,allows the 12,federal reserve banks,to issue additional,currency on good assets,and thus the banks that,reopen will be able to meet,every legitimate call.,It is sound currency,because it is backed,by actual good assets.,And so what happens is,that there's an event.,And then when the event,happens, then everybody wakes up,and sadly there's what we,call in a financial system,,contagion, and people,unload, they unload stocks,,they try to get their,derivatives repaid.,They want their insurance,policies cashed.,And the market,starts to unravel.,When the market,starts to go down,,the plugs get pulled everywhere.,And so what you're dealing,with in climate change,,it's not only the direct impact,,but also the possibility,of contagion.,Economic contagion.,- Economic contagion.,- Financial.,Yep.,Those views are,merely forecasts,,and as always will,evolve with the arrival,of new information.,Mike, they're on the,bell, hold the bell.,the bells.,We actually have made it clear,that we will bail out,these financial actors.,We will bail them.,This cannot be sustained.,If it runs only because,the central banks go in,and buy assets, right?,Recently it was,proposed that the,European Central Bank,should also start buying,shares of companies.,So not only debt, but shares.,So we're effectively,socializing the obligation,to create financial returns,for the holders,of capital assets.,And that can't go on forever.,Even though every,politician says,,""This is the most important,election in your lifetime."",These forces aren't tamed or,unleashed by a single election.,In the news in the,last couple of weeks,,we've read about,the coronavirus.,And dude, China's acting like,this is like,zombie apocalypse.,I'm actually kind,of afraid of that,- corona virus, man.,- Yeah. No, I don't wanna get,on a plane.,Do we have a government,that's competent enough,and organized enough to,handle that kind of response?,No, man. I mean,,we can't even handle,like homelessness,in the city of LA.,You know what I mean?,Like we can't even figure out,how to properly fund anything,,let alone a pandemic.,Americans live,under the illusion,that they're incredibly,different from other people.,When I was in college,just everything started,to melt down in the Balkans,,everyone's like, ""These,people are savages."",""They've been fighting each,other for hundreds-of-years."",It's like they just came down,out of the trees or something.,Then you're there,and you realize,these people live in houses,that have electricity,and two-car garages,and refrigerators,and not only,children in college,,but several generations that,have gone through college,and they all spoke,the same language.,And these people,Killed each other.,They committed genocide,,250,000 killed, rape camps,,concentration camps,,ethnic cleansing.,This was a plan to,ethnically cleanse Kosovo,and get rid of the,Albanian population.,Are we going to stand for that?,Is France going to stand,for that? I don't think so.,Like many countries,as a system starts,to break down the,,in their case, it was,the communist system,,and in our case, our,capitalist system,is starting to break down,and people turn on each other,because some leaders think,""Everybody's upset right now,and I can motivate my group"",""to take stuff from,another group."",Europe has,not seen displaced people,in these numbers since,the Second World War.,And those are the kinds of,things we have to worry about,with climate change,,because it happens when,,resources start to get tight,,and everybody's a human,,everybody's prone to these things.,We've pre-cut boards that,we can put over the windows,in the event that there are,looters and things like that,to protect the house.,Yeah. You saw what,you want right?,We knew they wanted.,The UN said just two weeks,ago, a billion within 30 years.,Okay. A billion displaced,people, a billion refugees,because they can't grow their,food the way they used to,because of the drought,or because of floods,or because of,collapse of systems.,How much,worse is this gonna get,before it gets better?,I think the general view,is this is going to,continue deteriorating,for the time being,,the next rains are,a long while off.,For the world, this,is a very bad thing,because it's billions,of people dislocated,,massive economic consequences.,Can you have a,society that's been,as successful as this one,has in a material sense?,And can it transform itself?,You know, in the past empires,haven't been able to do that.,What would these Romans say?,Could they help us?,Unlikely.,Unlikely.,The heritage of,America is Roman.,All the men who wrote their,constitution had studied,the history of Rome,,I mean, the Senate it's Roman.,And it's failing us just,like the Roman Senate failed.,You know, there was a,Greek philosopher who said,that governments,go through cycles.,They go from a,democracy to oligopoly,to dictatorships,and they collapse.,I know we're talking,about Aristotle but..,Actually it wasn't Aristotle,,it was a different guy.,No, it was Aristotle.,No, it was maybe,it was Polybius,,I forget who it was.,I'll bet you cash,,it's Aristotle.,'Cause we're in Vegas, I will,bet you cash it's Aristotle,,because Aristotle came,up with the definitions,of the three kinds,of governments,and their alter egos.,So you have a democracy,which when it goes bad,,becomes a mobocracy.,You have a monarchy,,which when it goes,bad becomes a tyranny,and you have an aristocracy,,which when it goes bad,becomes an oligopoly.,He's building on the,work of a predecessor.,What's the name of,the predecessor?,We have to find that out.,I don't,know, you tell me.,We'll find it.,I don't know, I,have to look it up.,Wealth was,obtained largely through trade,,into the warehouses,full of goods,from all over the,empire and beyond.,It was the wealthy few,rather than the many,,who benefited from the riches,and vast resources,of the empire.,This imbalance and the,irresponsible behavior,of public officials,,would become major reasons,for Rome's eventual decline.,Okay, so dad,and I had this bet,and I need you to,see if I'm right,- or he's right.,- Okay.,It's about Aristotle.,Oh boy.,I know, I know.,So I was like well,,Aristotle described,,the death of democracy,and what happens,to different forms of,government as they decay.,Well you see Alessia, I know,from also from your studies,,that the collapse,of the Roman Empire,was mainly a huge, gigantic,,enormous, humongous,,financial collapse.,At some point, the emperors,had just run out of money.,There are lots of,different theories,why the Roman,Empire did collapse.,I think what we know now,,is that there has been,a long economic decline,before the Roman,Empire collapsed,,before the German,hoards came down,and conquered Italy,,and conquered Rome,,ultimately, right?,So the question is what triggered,the long economic decline?,Disparity between,the rich and the poor.,Onistorus and Miliorus they...,Yes, you're,speaking Latin now.,Yeah, yeah Latin.,Massive amounts of inequality,may not be politically,sustainable.,Governments fund themselves,through either debt,,or through taxation.,In Rome you would basically go,and try to squeeze,more returns out of,provinces that you occupied,,or you might launch another,war to get the returns,,to feed Rome and,feed those who were,running the system overall.,And I think that's,the common denominator,because we live in a quite,different system today, right?,So today it's our central banks,who are doing the,rescue operation.,One thing about the,financial markets,,one of their real power is,,if they can pull forward,action from the future,to the present, if,there's credible policy,,after all, most of,what central banks do,is effectively that.,So big trees fall hard.,The market can,adapt to anything,,as long as there's clarity,,transparency and honesty,and I don't think,we're getting that.,There were a lot of things,that caused the problem,,but, I mean, essentially,,the structure of Rome,held together for,a good long time,,until finally it just ran out,of economic wherewithal,and leadership.,Politicians were bought,,what the founders of,our republic warned us,about over and over that,if you get really wealthy,and you lose your moral,character, it's over.,Well, that's where we are.,Because we are very,close to a moment,in which we could,start slowly going down,and if we are not very careful,,we will go down faster and,faster and faster and faster.,Roller coaster.,It will be a lot of fun, maybe.,You know the,ancient malediction,,may you live in,interesting times.,So, that's how,it ended last time.,Except this time, it,won't just be barbarians,,it'll be the planet,itself that's on fire.,There's still,active fire in that area.,Monitor the conditions,and know what you'll do,if the fire threatens,In the smoky,aftermath of the worst start,to fire season,anyone can remember,,while some search for solutions,,others want someone to blame.,Probably should take a,break and let it settle in,,take an intermission.,Financial ingenuity has,been part of this system,since the Dutch invented the...,Okay,,- But a lot of it,- liability company,- isn't financial,- and Lloyds of London.,But dad, listen.,People get pretty...,Everybody thought Bernie,Madoff was a genius.,Yeah.,Foreign investors looked,at the United States,and said, ""the United,States they're the best.,""That's the safest place in,the world I can put my money"".,I mean, we've,had, I don't know,,five, six biblical-like events.,We're continuing to have them,,so I need to,question the validity,of the value of, and viability,of my land long-term.,A little over seven years ago,,Hurricane Sandy,blew through here,,causing tens of billions of,dollars in property damage,,and since then, New,York has built more,,bigger, taller and more,expensive, because we, the people,,are on the hook for the,cost of the insurance,if another hurricane comes,and hits New York City.,The National Flood,Insurance Program,is a federally-run public,program of insurance.,It's run by the Federal,Emergency Management Agency.,It provides flood insurance,for virtually all homeowners,and small businesses,in the country.,So this is pretty,unusual, actually.,Most other countries,have private markets,for flood insurance,,but the U.S does not.,It's a supplementary,policy that is subsidized,by the government, and so all,citizens are, to some extent,,footing the bill for,coastal property owners.,In order to build a huge,condominium development,in a flood plain in New,York City, you, of course,,need a lot of capital.,Municipal actors in New York,City are very interested,in continuing to promote a,version of New York City,,in which as much of the,available land remains viable,for continued,economic development,,because property taxes are so,important there, as elsewhere.,Well, the original program,of the National Flood,Insurance Program,was supposed to stop,construction in very high risk areas.,Areas where water,moves with velocity,,particularly flood,ways along the river,,where water moves the,same rate as the river,,hurricane-zoned areas, where,the storm surge comes in.,The building is,,it's almost impossible to,build a really safe building,against a 14-foot wall,of water coming in at you,in a storm surge.,There's a lot of vested,interests that don't care,,construction,industry, for example.,They'd like to build,a house on a beach,while the tide is out, as,long as they can sell it,before the tide comes back in.,And once they've,sold it, of course,,the risk is now somebody else's.,The ways in which financial,actors securitized mortgages,in the run-up to the,last financial crisis,is still going on.,So the building,contractors all want,to minimize the flood program.,The town wants to minimize it,,wanna hold down the,elevations on the maps,and fight that every,map that comes out,by the National Flood,Insurance Program,,that causes problems,,delay in implementation,,maybe never implementation.,The coastal communities,are on some of the most,valuable land in the country,,And as a consequence,,people are gonna fight,to protect their,investment position.,I thought, okay, the,city's not requiring me,to have flood insurance.,My realtor didn't tell me I,had to have flood insurance.,Honestly, you don't,look at the flood maps,when you move into,a neighborhood.,You fall in love with the,house, and 85% of the people,in my neighborhood,were not insured.,Shelter.,The United States,is uniquely vulnerable,to building into,disaster-likely,,physically vulnerable areas,,because of our reliance,on local rule, particularly,for zoning decisions.,That's part of our bedrock,of the United States,,state rights and local rights,,and it's actually has,a lot of advantages,,but it has a major disadvantage,,which is that local,governments depend on revenues,that are coming from their,buildings, from their residents,who are building and,living in their localities,,and that means that all residents,benefit from development.,The politics of provision,are so tied up with land values,in the United States, that,if property values go down,,then the tax assessments,adjust to reflect that,,and you're bringing in less,revenue for the tax base,,which means less investment,in local amenities,and schools and local,public transportation.,In Texas, we don't,have state income tax.,That's another reason,why you wanna live here,,because it's cheap, but people,are taxed on their land.,The maps that are in,existence for where a 100,or 500-year flood will,happen are so outdated,and no longer accurate, the,risk and the cost of that risk,,even within the insurance,industry, is not as accurate,as it needs to be, in,order for us to appreciate,what the cost of climate is.,Insurance actors,have found ways,to take an insurance,policy and securitize that,,and transfer it to kind,of capital risk markets,,so they're not really,holding the bag,,which means that they're,willing to underwrite more,and more property,,which means that people,can kinda continue to build,in risky areas.,I don't think anyone,would wanna come in,and look at the house and,come through salt water,and wanna buy it.,- This is my nest egg.,- Yeah, this is your nest egg.,This is how I'm gonna help,my kids and my retirement.,But now, because you,bought it in an area,where there's rising sea level,,maybe that nest,egg's not so secure.,In order to convert,his nest egg to cash,,he's gotta be able,to sell the house,,but now nobody will insure,the next 30 year mortgage.,What happens to John?,John's lost,his retirement nest egg.,Okay, so John is now,literally John on the street.,The nice house,that we're gonna buy,in Florida to retire...,This was their,house in Florida.,They were gonna move to Alabama.,Okay, well,,they're not moving.,They may still move to Alabama.,They may be living,in a trailer park.,Flood involves,the U.S government,in this really peculiar way,,fire is privately underwritten,,so it's private insurers,and what's happening,with fire risk,,is that some of the,primary insurers,are going out of business,,in events like the,California wildfires,,that can put an insurer,out of business,,if they have,outstanding liabilities,that exceed what,they can pay off.,Then,we started talking,and you told me,about buying a house,in Sausalito.,So what happened?,So we call the insurance,company two days before,,two or three days before,and let them know we're,gonna close in a few days.,And they call us back and say,,""Hey, we can't,insure that house"",And I'm like, ""what?"",And they're like "" yeah, it's,on a list of neighborhoods"",""that we don't insure anymore"",So these entire neighborhoods,are gonna be uninsured,and they also told us,,they don't know if,they're gonna reinsure,the current owner,of the house either.,That's an entire,,billions of dollars of,houses across the state,,that it's gonna have,an insurance problem.,The insurance companies,are insuring for one year.,So as things get worse,,the insurance companies,are definitely not,going to be able,to come to the rescue,of these homeowners.,These latent,,hidden climate risks,that might exist in,different places,,in different housing markets,,should they burst,,could take down,the entire financial system.,And right now this house,is listed for $49,000.,At the peak of the market,,it went to about $250,000.,It's not only the owners,that lose their assets,,it's the financial,intermediaries that lose,their claims against them.,It's those that bought,the secularized mortgages,and other assets that,are linked to them,,just as we've seen,in the 2008 crisis.,And unless we're prepared,to continue to write,the same check over,and over again,,we need to start to scrutinize,,are we hardening the utilities,and the infrastructure,around these homes sufficiently,,so they can weather these,storms going forward?,Or should we in fact not permit,the investment of capital,,that is going to be subject to,,climate change conditions,in a negative way,and we need to think about that.,No, that's the,really scary thing,because we're not, you,know we're not hardening,any of our infrastructure.,I mean, not yet.,It's very expensive.,There's guys thinking about it,,but nobody's done it yet.,Well, from an oil,company standpoint,,most of the major assets,in the United States,and actually globally,,are on the coastline.,From that standpoint, the,facilities are as vulnerable,as people's homes.,So there's a lot of,offshore infrastructure,in the Gulf of Mexico,,but that comes on shore,to a lot of pipelines,that are right at the coastline.,And so as the coastline erodes,,those pipelines become,noticeable and vulnerable,and have to be buried deeper,,or infrastructure put,around it to protect it.,So indeed, yeah, hardening,of infrastructure,,utilities and fires have,been associated with that,,or the pipelines.,People are worried about how,to protect those going forward.,Nature's gonna be,eroding the foundations,of our economy.,So, sometimes I'm out,in a place like this,,and I imagine what it,would be like to come here,with no money in my pocket,,fleeing an economic meltdown,,'cause you know look, we,do have plenty of land,,but if I had to survive out here,and didn't have the money,to buy something to,provide me power,,some way to get water,,out of a fairly dry land,,while we love pristine nature,and we like to hike in it,,hunt in it, camp in it,,all those things we do,thanks to the technology,that you bought at the store.,The tent, the gun,,the flashlight,,the lighter, these things are,made in human communities,,in factories, not by,people on the run,,not by people out of capital.,It's all about capital.,So here's what happens,,capital is gonna flow to where,it can make the most money,for the capital owner.,A town like this,,which was a silver mining town,,is a good example,of foraging theory,,where if you're an animal or,,and these things translate,into the human world as well,,and you've got a choice,between two things,,one that's easy to get,and one that's hard to get.,If the easy thing to,get is worth more,,that's what you're gonna go for.,So that's what,produces boom towns,,because at one point the silver,was really easy to get to,and worth something,and then when the,silver market crashed,,well, it wasn't worth anything.,So they moved on, to find the,next easiest thing to mine.,These patterns of capital,do not change over time.,Capital is always gonna,seek the greatest return,and as soon as that,return isn't paying off,,it's gonna pull up stakes,and go somewhere else.,The way to define,capital is the money,that is going to be used,to create something.,People are very myopic.,They are just looking at,what's in front of their face,and the portfolio,that's right there,,how they're gonna make,money in the short term.,How you doing Frank?,So look, we look,around and it's like,,this is all the capital,,this is all the,capital in the world,,headquartered right here.,Right.,And I'm assuming they,all wanna live past 2050,and so we gotta change over.,Are they beating down a,trail to your door to invest?,No, they're not.,We have to search for the,right type of investors,for our projects.,And when we do find the,investors for our projects,,it's extremely difficult,to create the value,or pull out the value for our,projects that the investors,recognize immediately.,If somebody can get 15% on,their money doing derivatives,,why would they wanna,get 5% on their money,doing renewable?,Because they would be able,to use the investment,tax credit.,Everybody wants a return,and everybody wants to,maximize their return.,And the only groups that I,know can maximize their return,for renewable energy,projects today,,are the wealthy individuals,that have passive income.,And, what do we think of,as like wealthy individuals?,So I think a lot of Americans,think if someone has $500,000,,they are a wealthy individual.,I'm talking about,people who have,hundreds and hundreds of,millions of dollars of net worth.,So minimum, a hundred,million dollars of net worth.,I would say so, but,there's not many people,maybe less than 1%,of the population,that has that type of,investment portfolio,,or investments generating,passive income.,Any more comments?,That's pretty close,all right, pretty close.,Perfect.,All right.,So when there's not investment,in the market towards,the technology,that would help for,climate solutions,,and renewables and clean energy,,then that trickles,down into the entire,,the entire life,stream or life cycle,,you know, the whole,flow of business.,Lord Keynes, who was the,founder of macro economics,asked the question,,why do people invest?,And honestly, there's no answer.,He called it animal spirits.,I can tell you people,are risk averse.,And after 2008, they're,even more risk averse.,When I go to these,business conferences,and I see my friends,,I asked the guy who's worth,a hundred million dollars,,I said, what are,you working on now?,He says, you know,,he said, I'm just,,I'm pretty happy where I am,and you know, I've got,the house in Mexico,and we're looking,after the grandkids,,and I mean, he's not,investing in taking risks.,He's not creating jobs,for the rest of us,,at least not directly.,That's the animal spirits,that are out there,in too much of the business,community right now.,So the only way you,can replace that,is with government leadership.,The Erie Canal, the,Transcontinental Railroad,,the Panama Canal,,the space program,,the interstate highway system,,in no case did a group of,entrepreneurs get together,and say, hey let's build the,interstate highway system.,No, it was a dream,that Ike pushed in 1955,that came from a study done,during World War,II that showed that,you needed these highways for,national security purposes.,This is no partisan policy.,No one has a monopoly on truth,,and on the facts that,affect this country,,we must work together.,The United States is,highly dis-aggregated.,We have 50 states, one nation,,many counties, many regions,,tens of thousands of cities,they all have a voice,in how things are done.,And it's hard to get us to,collaborate on certain projects,,unless we all align and,agree it's necessary,and we feel some,urgency to get it done.,If the Australian,military study,,the U.S military study,,and the British military,study are all correct,we've got about 30 years,if we don't do anything,until civilization collapses.,Which I'm guessing doesn't,have a good rate of return.,Correct?,So Wes there are actually those,who would tell,you that we may be,beyond the tipping,point already,,I don't subscribe,to that, by the way.,If you do subscribe to that then,it almost makes,the investment in,,you know wind and,solar, not pertinent.,What's the most,valuable thing in the world?,The most valuable thing,,it's oil reserves in the ground.,It's worth more than the,GDP of the United States,,more than the stock market,,more than the stock markets,of all the Western countries,,it's oil in the ground,,and the people that have that,oil, they want it to be used.,Whatever you hear,about Saudi Arabia,saying they're,going to, you know,move beyond a petrol,based economy, yell, yell,,but they're going to,move at their pace,and they need those petro,dollars to get there.,The societal costs right,now are much greater,than the economic costs of,taking it out of the ground.,So you have to recognize,the societal impact,and you have to make the people,who are producing,it and selling it,,and the people who are buying it,pay the full cost of using it.,And that, that means a tax.,But we didn't even do,that with security though,,because I mean, realistically,we've subsidized the oil,industry for 50 years,by knocking over governments,,by protecting shipping,lanes for it, oil lanes,,so we couldn't even do,it when it came to like,having them pay for their,own extraction and security.,It's true.,But one of the reasons we,couldn't do it is because,,we didn't really,have the alternative.,What's the sound?,We didn't really have the,alternative technically.,Engineers,worked under fire,to douse oil,pipelines set ablaze,by retreating Iraqi troops.,Animal fats, and tallow,could no longer supply,the ever growing need for,candles and lubricants.,Whale oil, which had long,been the chief illuminant,,was becoming scarce.,Yet the demand for artificial,light was increasing.,In 1850, a lamp capable,of efficiently burning,a refined product of,petroleum was invented.,Oil!,Oil!,Early oil production,,they used steam power,for the drilling,,for the riggings,of different pieces,of equipment,,and that steam power,probably was produced,by burning wood or coal.,So you'd use wood,or coal to get oil.,Today, we use,electricity to get oil.,We use gas to get oil.,So we use one form of,energy to get another.,And that's one of the,interconnected aspects,of energy that's kinda,surprising for people,is how interdependent is.,We don't have an economy that,runs on one form of energy,,we have an economy that,runs on many forms.,Part of this equation,,certainly in the short term,to this time period,you're worried about,,is modulating consumption and,adjusting cultural behavior.,But people aren't,talking about that,,no one wants to blame anybody.,If you wanna blame industry,,well, industry exists because,people buy their things,or use their things.,So they're the,ultimate consumers.,Are we gonna carbon tax them?,Are we gonna punish them?,Or maybe part of,the equation is,,we all accept responsibility,and we get a cultural,change to take place here,to go back to where we were,20, 30 or 40 years ago.,We might, but that's hard.,The vast majority of our,individual impact comes from,,housing, transport and food.,These are kinda big,structural issues,that can't really be,addressed adequately,by changing the brand,of paper towels you buy.,We live in an energy,consumption society.,And the way to look at things,,we have to be aware that,nothing comes for free.,We have to be aware that,everything costs energy,,whatever you do.,This is not what public,space looks like in the U.S,,but I noticed here,in the Netherlands,,everybody's riding,bikes everywhere.,Yeah. Yeah.,And that doesn't,strangely require gasoline.,Nope.,The question,is, can we replace,fossil fuels with,renewable energy?,And this is a very,tricky question.,It raises enormous debates,and people get angry when,you asked them this question,,because it is not,clear what you mean.,If you mean that you can,satisfy people's greed,with renewable energy,,then the answer is no.,If you mean renewable,energy could produce,a sufficient amount of,energy in order to survive,,then the answer is yes.,We are in an energy efficient,home now, that we've rebuilt,that our household use,alone is twice the size,of the average American,,that woke me up,,I can't count the,number of trips,that I've taken around,the world for business,,but that two,international trips,,was equal to one year of,utility energy in my home.,And that really had me,thinking about travel.,It had me thinking,about what I eat.,Another,surprise for many people,is how much energy we,use in the food system.,And,complete dinners.,In,the United States,,we use 100 quadrillion,BTU of energy a year.,A BTU is our British,thermal unit.,One BTU is about the energy,content of a kitchen match.,So in the United States, we use,100 billion million kitchen,matches of energy per year.,10 quads, 10 quadrillion,BTU is for the food system.,One of those quads is,in the food itself.,Food is a form of energy.,We're ingesting at one quad,of food energy into our bodies,for 330 million,Americans every year.,The other nine quads is for,the rest of the food system.,This is in the agrochemicals,,the fertilizers and pesticides,diesel for tractors, the,energy for refrigeration,,the energy for drying,crops at silos,,warehouses, transportation,,plus the energy to,cook at our homes.,Pies are done.,Three or,four quads of that,is just for the cold chain.,That's the refrigeration system:,Refrigerated trucks,,refrigerated warehouses,,and refrigerators and freezers,at our homes and businesses.,The energy embedded,in the cold chain,of the food system,in the United States,is more energy than,entire countries,like Switzerland and Sweden,consume in a year combined.,The energy embedded in the,edible food we throw away,is also enough to power,entire countries elsewhere.,Sadly, we throw away like,a fourth to a half,of our edible food.,Okay so,Michael, here we are.,We're surrounded by water.,Yeah.,And what's,the relationship,between water and energy?,The water energy,relationship is twofold.,One is we use a lot,of water for energy.,We use water to,cool power plants,,we use water to,irrigate biofuels,,we use water for oil,and gas production,,we use water to make,steam at refineries.,In fact, if you look all up and,down the energy supply chain,water's at every step.,Our well went dry.,Dead.,Yeah, that's dead.,This is where the water,,that would be the full mark.,It's not a fantasy,apocalypse movie landscape.,It's now and it's real.,So the grid might be strained,if you don't have water,available for cooling,,at least the way we have,most power plants today,,where they use heat,,they then need a,water for cooling.,Modern forms of like solar,panels or wind turbines,don't need water coolings.,The average life for PV,panels is what, 20 years?,20, 25 years.,20, 25 years.,- Maybe 30 years, yeah.,- So the people who say,,well, it takes seven,years of energy,to produce this PV panel,,but then you're getting,,that means you're getting 18,years of energy free.,So you've cut down.,Even then you're getting 18,years of energy for free.,So me John Q Public,,I'm like, hey man,,I wanna put some money,into your solar farm.,No, not until the government,gets involved with things,,puts us into a pari passu,position with fossil fuels.,I've got a lot of friends,who are in the,renewable business,,and there's a really,big problem in terms of,,you know, you've got the,power purchase agreement,,you've got all the,permitting done,,You've even got,interconnect agreements,,except what's happening is,,grid companies are delaying,and not letting,them on the grid.,What's going on with that?,I think one of the,challenges we have is,,who has access to,the infrastructure,and democratizing,the infrastructure,is a way to open it up so that,more solutions can,be brought forward.,This is something that we did,with telecommunications,in the 80s with AT&T,,AT&T had built out all,the wires and poles,,and they were,required to open up,their infrastructure,for other companies.,And that's why we have,so many phone companies,,and long distance companies,now that we didn't have before.,The same thing could happen,with democratizing the,electrical infrastructure.,More solutions would be,plugged in more wind and solar,,and we have more,technologies along the way.,And this is where,long range planning,,stable governance really matter.,Kind of what I'm hearing is,,it's not a technology problem.,No, not a technology problem.,It's not an,engineering problem.,- No.,- It's a financial engineering problem.,Energy poverty, lack,of food, income inequality.,So it's up to us now,to form the policy,that is going to,help bridge this gap.,In 1941, when the,United States went to war,,and people saved tin,cans and aluminum,and gave up, women gave,up buying nylon stockings,,and everything was done,for the war effort.,But the war was there,,was right in front of us.,And young men were being,drafted and sent overseas,,and casualties were coming home.,And this is different.,It requires the same type of,reorganization or commitment.,But why didn't,they call on me?,I could have done something.,That was then,,and this is now.,Check out our new lot,the okay solutions lot with,millions of new solutions,and more coming,every single day.,Looking for something that's,easy and in your price range,,check out our,pre-owned solutions.,Like changing a light,bulb or walking to work,,or our mid-sized selections,like regenerative agriculture,,or a price on carbon,,or you'll love a variety,of brand new solutions with,that brand new solution smell.,Like de-leveraging climate risk,from the derivatives market,,or the million mile battery,,which is coming soon.,Just listen to one of,our satisfied customers.,Michael, you are now in,charge of the United States,Energy policy and,you have free reign.,How would we make,the transition?,For national security reasons,and for economic reasons,and for environmental reasons,there are many,reasons to do this.,We need to harden, improve,and expand our grid.,Maybe even using the,interstate highways.,We already have the rights,of way and put lines,above ground or below ground,,create a national network.,And then it will span and,reach to the sunny windy areas,,and already connects,to the urban areas.,And once we have the network,,we can plug in whatever we want,,build the infrastructure first,,then the energy will follow.,But we have to put a,price on pollution.,We'll take the money from,the price on pollution,to clean up the trash.,So let's take the United States,6 billion tons of CO2 a year,,put in the atmosphere.,And let's say we're,willing to pay,I don't know, $30,a ton to remove it.,That works out to if I,do my math correctly,,$180 billion a year.,Sounds like a lot of money.,That's less than what we spend,on just dealing with,trash from cities.,Why not spend another couple,hundred billion cleaning,up the waste in the atmosphere.,Let's take the CO2,and put it into the soil.,Like, let's pay farmers,to take the Co2,out of the atmosphere,into the soil.,We need to get more of that,national security mindset.,If you have a built,to last strategy,,then you do want to look at,what's happening in,these longer horizons,and it's absolutely critical.,It's gonna take,all forms of energy,and all people to move us,through this transition.,Otherwise, I don't think,we actually stand a chance.,I'm trying to get,rid of this car,,but it's like quitting,smoking, it's not easy.,You are so used,to certain things,that it is very difficult.,The Romans had done,a lot of bad things,to the ecosystem.,Yeah.,But, they had not,destroyed it as we could do.,- FEMA estimates for every,dollar spent on hazard mitigation,you save $4 in disaster,recovery costs.,So we're already,spending the money.,There's the sense that,it's perhaps too expensive,to prepare for climate change,,but we are already,spending the money.,We're spending it after,every disaster hits.,When I was growing,up, there was the draft.,So everybody thought they had,an obligation to the country.,If you went to a land-grant,college you were drafted.,Now it's different.,The trust in government's gone,,the obligation to,government is gone.,If we could take some of,that spirit of patriotism,and service and rebuild,it into doing something,for the environment.,This entire thing,is built out of carbon,that comes out of,the atmosphere.,We need a hundred,thousand young people,to give up part of their summer,and form up and,really work this.,We could control,these pine beetles,that are destroying the forest.,We could plant new trees, but,it should be done not only,for pay as a guaranteed job,,but it should also be done,for every citizen's obligation,to take care of the land.,That's what I'd like to see.,It sounds like you're trying,to inspire a whole generation,of people to pay for it.,Well, it sounds like something,that old guys would say.,Whoa.,Baby baby.,Can you smile for us?,That's a good noise.,It's made me want to be more,of a fighter for her sake.,The transformation is,potentially exciting,,because we can think not only,about losing things that,we have always wanted,but also letting go of things,that we perhaps,don't benefit from.,We can lose in order to,transform into something else.,It's not as kind of confident,that things will be okay,,but it finds possibility,in a ways that,things will have to change,in kind of really dramatic ways.,And so we are looking,at diversifying the types,of crops that we are,wanting to plant,,and also work with,conservation type programs,to help preserve,species and habitat.,And let nature take it's course,and bring back,species that we need,and that the crops actually,need to be productive.,We don't want a,hurricane or a tropical storm,,they're already geared up,the crops are turned in.,They wanna go ahead,and get finished.,People wanna know where,their food came from.,Well, at some point maybe,people will wanna know,where their banker,lives and who he is.,And do I have a,relationship with him,that when I need some,money to fix something,I can maybe find,somebody to help me?,Yeah, I mean,,it's not a matter of,the government,telling banks what to do,,or telling us what we can do.,No, I mean, there's still,lots of possibilities.,We should have smaller banks,basically split them up,,and not make them,too big to fail.,If they make mistakes, they,should fail without causing,a total systems crisis.,And probably what also needs,to be done is introduce rules,which make it impossible,for the financial sector,to create within the,financial sector itself,so much additional debt.,We have to somehow correct,this market imperfection.,If you want to,have a derivative,,if you want to hedge,your risk fine,,but you must have exposure,to the underlying asset.,I remember,I was watching on TV,after a major flood,down in Florida,,and they were interviewing,this guy and he said,,""My father rebuilt twice, my,grandfather rebuilt twice."",And he says, ""And I'm,gonna rebuild again"".,And the reporter turned,into the camera and said,,""That's the American way"".,Well, I thought the reporter,should say, that's stupid.,You can't keep doing,it over and over again,that's the definition,of insanity.,So it's basically trust,in the monetary management,and trust in the future,productivity of a country,that gives us trust,in the currency.,Not the idea that there,are some gold barons hidden,in the federal reserve.,And so there is a,point of resistance,at which governments,aren't going to be,,have access to capital,to address the problem.,We're rich.,You know, the fear is,,if we cannot bail out,the system anymore,it will come crushing down,with huge side effects.,The hope and that,sounds a little cynical,but I think the hope is,we probably can reorder,our system only after a crash.,And I think that human,history is such that,we are unable to make,really fundamental change,in the way we live and the,way we organize ourselves,without such a crash.,Nobody wants it, and I'm the,last person who wants it.,And if I think back to the,1930s, and I'm German, right?,And you think about,what the repercussions,of a major crisis can be.,We just don't know how,we would get out on,the other end of the tunnel.,I think without this,crisis, I just don't see,enough political leverage,to fundamentally alter,the way we organize,our financial system.,When climate change happens,,there will be real problems,and it will be real,,as you said, there will,be real scarcities,,and it will be real migrants,coming, and there will be an...,And that's what I,,and then will really be,broke because it'll be,after you've had that collapse,of the inverted pyramid.,And then it's like, then it's,like asking Somalia to,fight climate change.,Yeah, yeah.,So your,criticism would be,that we're not facing reality,and not adapting to it?,That's correct.,My answer to that is, I,still have faith in democracy.,I believe we can,do it as a people.,I believe we can,do it as a society.,And I believe we can,take the institutions,of the United States that have,served this country very well,for over 200 years, and,move into the 21st century,and still help lead,mankind forward.,It's an article of,faith, but it's the faith,that motivates action.,We have almost all the tools,and all the financial resources,,and all the institutions that,could solve this problem.,It's the kind of challenge that,could bring mankind together,in a way we've never been,brought together before.,I wish there was,more conversation,,more guys on the opposite,side talking together.,Because everybody as we feel,,there are people feeling,opposite from us,that are just as righteous,and all of that stuff.,But we ought to get,together to see...,The thing if you get,together with people like this,,what you find is,the disagreements,- are pretty narrow actually.,- Yes, that's what I mean.,The people are mostly,agreed on like 95%.,Yeah.,But, but there are,forces in the culture,that want to sharpen and,popularize those disagreement.,Yeah.,It's a human nature issue.,Okay?,So what sells?,Tell me, what sells?,What do you pay attention to,when it's happening around you?,You gotta find people...,Conflict, conflict, conflict.,- It's true. It's true.,- That's it.,To create that,kind of a dialogue,between a father and a son,,that love thing, I,mean, this is my kid.,You guys must have some,wild conversation man.,It's what gets me.,- I totally...,- This is the basis,- disagree with that.,- Of democracy and capitalism.,No, I disagree with that.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Hot_Money-13837022

again it's gonna be,for the rest of his life,,and,, he may,not be the greatest guy,,but he is not a murderer.,- I get it, I do.,Please, go on.,- I don't know where to start.,I mean we were normal,kids, you know, normal,,you know, doing normal kid,things, going to school.,But then,,god,,our mother, our,mother was a monster!,- Rachel do you want to,forget about his for now,,because I can always,come back later tonight--,- No just the, just the,thought of her just...,It's okay, go ahead.,- As long as you're,comfortable with it,,we can continue, okay?,- All right, this is too,important, I have to,get the story out.,I'm such an ugly crier!,No you're not!,- All right, go ahead.,- Whenever you're ready,,your mother, you,were talking about her.,- Yeah, her, you,would not believe,the things that she did to us,when we were kids.,Like, you would not believe it.,- You know what though,,you wouldn't believe,half of the things,that I have heard,in face to face interviews!,I mean think about it, I work,for Crime Scene Magazine,,not People.,- That's true.,- Trust me, I think,I can handle it.,- I think you could.,Where do we go from here?,My mother.,She was sick, so sick!,- Cancer, or...,- If only it was cancer, no,,she was sick in the head!,- How so?,- This woman was pure evil.,It didn't, we didn't have,to do anything wrong,,and, I mean she would,just hit us for no reason!,Oh...,If she could be carrying,a book, or anything,,a bat it didn't matter,,she would just hit us,on the back of the head!,- For just no reason at all?,- No, she didn't need a reason!,She ruled the roost, I mean,,we all knew it, Dad knew it,,and I mean, he tried to, he,tried, he tried to help us but,,that, that didn't matter.,Oh and if we actually,did do something wrong,,then there was the belt.,- The belt?,Yeah, she would run into,our father's room, grab, the,belt off the back of his door,,and she would come storming down,like she was demon possessed!,- Wait a minute you,said she went into,your father's room?,- Uh-hmm.,- You mean your parents,,they had separate bedrooms?,- Yeah, if you were,married to a bat like that,would you want to,sleep with her?,- I don't know.,- Dad, Dad tried to, he,tried to be there for us but,,he was gone all,the time, so it just,,it was just us and her.,He left us to fend for,ourselves, he was, gone...,- I can't blame,him, for not wanting,to be around her.,- Yeah.,As soon as Danny, the, our,little brother turned 18,,he was up and packed,up, and took another job,in freaking Ohio.,- So, can we back up a sec?,Can you tell me what your,mother did to you?,- Yes, yes, once...,Just the thought of this,is really upsetting me.,Um, yeah she would beat us,with a belt, till,we had purple welts,all over our whole bodies.,The boys nicknamed,it the Welt Belt.,They got it more,often than I did,,I think she thought,she could cover up,bruises on boys, and,not so much on me, so...,- That's really despicable.,- Oh you think?,Oh, and get this, when,Dad was still around,,we had this horrible,neighbor, I mean you,probably had the kind,who will call the cops,for the stupidest ...,- This is the third,time that I've had,to come over here, and tell,you keep your kids' toys,off my property, and,that means keep your,son's balls off my grass!,This is gonna stop or,I'm gonna call the cops!,And I'm gonna keep,on calling the cops,every time your,bratty little kids do,something to bother my family!,Do you hear me Mrs Leno?,Or do I have to yell?,Are you deaf, and stupid, and--,- Oh, it's you.,You know what, go back,to the hole you crawled,in from you bitch!,Glad to help you with,the day's exercise, pig!,- Wow, I thought that we had,crazy next door neighbors,growing up!,- Right?,Well hey, would,you like a donut?,I've got a donut, I'll,split one with you.,- Sure I'll take part of one.,- Perfect.,Yeah, neighbors are a, our,neighbor on the other side,,they were, they were pretty,cool, at least the guy was.,- Right.,- Hi wife on the,other hand, yeah she,would parade around,her yard, in a bikini,,all summer long.,Yeah, and then she'd think,she sees Danny watching her,from his upstairs,bedroom window.,- Oh my god.,- Probably,Jacking off.,- Your brothers.,- Exactly.,Well she comes over,,and tells mother,,that she catches Danny red-handed,,peeping into her room.,Yeah the beating,that he took, um,,he spent two weeks,in the hospital.,Two weeks, the school,did not even notice.,- I mean how is,that even possible?,I mean didn't you kids,ever think about reporting,her for child abuse, or what,about your grandparents,,or neighbors, friends--,- You can do that, you can,do that now, but back then,,we just, we just,took our lickings.,Mom was a monster.,- Well um, when did,the beatings end?,I mean they did end,sooner or later--,- Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.,Jake, he got in,trouble for something,,I don't even remember,what it was exactly.,But I do remember what,happened afterward.,- Oh Jesus, what,happened afterwards?,- Oh, let me tell you.,Yeah the three of us were,,playing in the house and we,heard this pounding on the door.,Mother took her,time to get there.,She opens the door and,this man is yelling,and screaming at her,,she didn't say anything.,Then she just slams,the door in his face,,and she turns around, and,she comes storming down,like she just escaped,a mental institution.,She goes into Dad's room,,comes out with that belt,,and she's just snapping that,belt, she's coming for us,,and I, I tried to shield,Danny, cover him up,,but she went right for Jake.,She's just whipping him,with this belt, wham,,wham, whipping him!,I yelled at her to stop,,but no, she just keeps,whipping him and Jake,he, I don't know what,got into him, he just,grabbed that belt from her,,and they're wrestling,back and forth,,he yanks that belt,right out of her hand,and she's like in shock!,She grabs her heart, uh,,and she just keels over,,has a heart attack, falls,right on the ottoman.,Jake, he didn't,know what happened,,he looks at us,and, he's in shock.,He comes over, and we hug,,and we thought this is,,this is a good thing.,Her death gave us new life.,Does that make sense Darcy?,- It absolutely does,,but of the two boys,,which one was in,trouble more often,,or were they both just,equal opportunity victims?,- Oh no no no no, it,was not equal at all!,Jake was older, and,he always seemed to be,on the receiving,end of all this.,Mother would yell, ""See,what happens to Jacob,""when you pull this shit?"",I swear that is the reason,that he went to the bottle.,I mean seriously,drinking, upwards of a,full fifth of whiskey in a day!,- Wow.,- Yeah, he went to calling,his favorite brand Jake Daniels.,Yeah when he was,drinking, oh he was nasty!,- I mean have you ever thought,about like intervention,,or AA, or anything like that?,- Yeah, he needed a 20-step,program, not a 12-stepper.,Yeah, when he drank,,he turned into this,,wife-beating menace!,He, he went to prison,two times, yeah,,for domestic,violence, and the cops,came to his house all the time.,- So after all this how did,you two end up reconnecting?,Wait, you know I'm,sorry, hold that thought,,what happened to your,younger brother, uh,,- Daniel?,- Daniel, you said, okay?,- Yeah, well Danny, he seemed,to get through this really well,,he got married, bought,a house, has kids,,white picket fence,,yep, going good for him.,- Well you obviously did very,well for yourself too Rachel,,I mean...,- Uh yeah, this is just,the perks of uh, being,a Real Estate Broker.,- Well it's beautiful.,- Yeah, yeah it is.,- It is, uh huh, so unless,I miss my guess here,,this is all about Jake, he's,the reason that I'm here.,- Yeah, Jake,,- Is that right?,- Yeah he vanished after his,two stints at Jackson Prison.,- Right.,- And I was, I was fine,with that, I thought he just,,just get his shit together,and go on with his life.,- So what made you decide to,try and find him again then?,- He's a suspect in a--,- I mean I get,that Rachel, I do,,and I know that you want me,to pass that information on,to authorities,,- Yes.,- But, I can't just,walk in there and say,""Hey I interviewed,his sister,"" you know,,""stop your investigation!"",- I get that.,- And I really do,,I want to help you.,- You know and I,,and I, I believe you.,- Why don't you give me,some more information,,like um, tell me about how,you two finally reconnected.,- Well Danny and I, we,,we never lost contact,,we've kept in touch, and,I've went to his house,,to see if he knew,where, where Jacob was.,- Well look what,the cat dragged in.,If it isn't my,little big sister.,- Really?,I even wore my,big shoes for you.,You act like you haven't,seen me in years.,- It sure seems like,it, to me anyway.,- Are you gonna let me in?,- Come on in.,So what's up,,wait, let me guess.,You've been watching,the news reports,,and you want to know where,our big brother Jake is,,am I close?,- Yeah, actually you're,right on the money,with that one.,- Well come on in.,- Sure.,So, where are,Donna and the kids?,- She took the kids to the mall.,- Oh, that's probably,a good thing.,- Go and have a seat.,- Thanks.,- So, what makes you think I,know where Jake is, anyway?,- Do you or don't you,Danny, because you know,we're both a little too old to,be playing this stupid game.,- Take a look around sis,,I've been a little busy,,trying to raise a family,,provide for my wife and kids,,while our big brother was,off making license plates.,- So you don't know,where he is, fine!,- That's it then,,the end of our chat?,Huh, nice, real nice,Rachel, couldn't give,two shits about me could you?,- I do care about you,,you're my little brother,,but, you're not,the one in trouble.,- Would you like something,to drink right now?,- Oh please.,- Lemonade okay?,- Yes.,- Listen, I had a lousy,spring season at the nursery,,I got four mouths to,feed, I got bills to pay.,Like I said, I got troubles too.,Your,troubles are fixable,,they're not with the law!,You watch the news!,- Yeah well, I tell you what,,if I did know where he was,,you wouldn't want,to see him anyway.,He's probably stewing up,there on his daily bottle of,Jake Daniels anyway.,- Up where?,- Huh?,- You said he's busy,stewing up there.,- Chill out sis,,what are you gonna do,,you gonna ride up there,on your white horse,and save the day?,Do you know where he is?,Just tell me.,- All these years, and suddenly,you're interested in him?,Stay the hell out of it!,He'll get what he,has coming to him.,- Wow you really don't,care about him do you?,- Don't put this on,me, Rachel Marie Leno!,- You know what, fine, I don't,know why I even bothered.,You know I would have thought,that you would have uh,,had some consideration,- Wait.,- For any of us.,- I'm sorry.,Come here, I'll fill you in.,I know you're,worried about Jake.,- Thanks Danny, you know it's--,- Sit back down.,- I am, I'm just,,I'm afraid for Jake!,- Well, you're,right to be, okay?,Our big brother,is prime suspect,,and he's way over his,head if you ask me.,- I'm just worried,about him, that's all.,Danny, you don't think Jake,is capable of this, do you?,- Oh hell no, he's scared.,That's why he's hiding out.,- Please, just tell,me where he is.,- Brewster house,,but he's wanted Sis,,and he's wanted in a bad way.,- Brewster house, man I,should of thought of that,a long time ago!,What are we gonna do?,- I'll tell you,what we're gonna do.,We're gonna cooperate,with the authorities.,If any cops come around,,we're gonna have to be honest,,and tell 'em about Jake's,not so glorious past.,- But just because he has a,violent past that shouldn't be,a reason for them to,consider him for this?,You think?,- Nah, that's not it at all.,- Well then what is it?,- Look,,when Jake sold the house he,was perfectly fair with us,,but you remember all,the instrument parts,,and the tools in the garage.,- Oh there was a,bunch of that stuff,,- Yes!,- Wasn't there?,Guitar fret board, there,was that big bass stand,in the back too, there was,a, there was a lot of it.,- -And the mound of piano wire?,Hello!,The damn fool, tried to,score some cash on the side,,and not let us in on it?,He sold a shit load of it.,I mean, he probably,needed the money but--,- Yeah, but the killer is,using piano wire to decapitate,those poor girls--,- Exactly!,That's why he's,the prime suspect.,- We need to see him,,we have to convince,him that he's gotta,be questioned by,the authorities!,- Well we'll go see him, okay?,- So you guys went up,to the Brewster house,,um, but weren't you a,little apprehensive?,- Well I don't know,about apprehensive,,but I had to talk,some sense into Jake.,I mean if they pinned,these murders on him,,he'd go to the jail for,the rest of his life.,Michigan had the death,penalty, he'd fry for sure.,So yeah, so I just went,up to the Brewster house.,- Wait hand on a minute,,what do you mean,,I went up to the Brewster house?,What, just you,,are you kidding me?,- I had to go right away,and Danny, he had the kids,and his wife and it's like,,yeah, I just went by myself.,- So, Danny boy told,you where I was, huh?,- Yeah he did.,- So why the sudden visit, huh?,Look, let me guess.,The cops are asking,questions about me.,They're trying to pin,those murders on me.,All because I sold that piano,wire from the god damn garage.,Shit, I was gonna,share it with you guys.,I swear to god!,- You know what Jake?,- I wish that, I wish...,- If you were hard up for,cash you could have come,to your brother or sister,and we could have figured,out some way to help you out,,and then if there would have,been any questions you know,,would'a been all of us siblings,that they'd be looking at,,and the heat wouldn't,be just on you.,- Oh great, hind-sight's,always 20-20.,- I know.,- Now I got the law breathing,down my neck, and,they're probably gonna,put me in the slammer.,And I'm not going back there,Rach, no fucking way, no way!,- But it's multiple,murders that you're facing!,How do the cops know,about the wire sale?,Oh, Bonny.,I'm sure of it, ex-number,two, remember her?,If anybody wanted,revenge against me for,punching her lights,out, it'd be that bitch.,- Oh, Bonny.,- Well, here in the,last thumb fight,,the topic of that psychopath,killer popped up, you know,,and she said in this,really weird tone,,""Jacob,"" and you know I,hate being called that,,'cause that was mother,used to call me that--,- Yeah when she'd pull,out the Welt Belt I know.,I can't even look at a,belt without flinching.,- Tell me about...,- Shitty way to remember,a parent, right?,- So anyway, she goes,""Jacob, you have some real,""aggressive tendencies,,who's to say you're not,""the serial killer?"",And then she goes ""Wouldn't,it be interesting if the,""police found out you,sold that piano wire?"",And me, you took it,for personal reasons.,So I didn't take,any chances then,,I left the east side and I,came here, where it's safe,,until the real killer's caught.,- And you told Danny you,moved here and not me?,- I couldn't tell you my story.,You get all,judgemental and shit,,- No I don't!,- You do.,Last thing I need is an,interrogation from you,as well as the cops, you know.,- Well, you know, I,kind of get it, but,,if you had nothing to do,with any of this, then...,- Well then a long pause.,If you think for one,second I had anything to...,There's a door you,can leave right now!,And don't come back this time!,- No no Jake, Jake, Jake!,You know you may, do,some awful things,,and you've got a bad,temper, but, there's,,you're flesh and blood,,there's no way I know,you are capable,of killing anyone,,unless maybe they,wanted to harm me,,or Daniel or Dad.,So now I'm sticking,around and we're gonna,,we're gonna get through this.,Blood is thicker than water.,Even Flint water,, Jacob.,- Right, what am I gonna do,,what am I gonna do next?,- Well, we're gonna,,we're gonna sit here,until we can figure out how,to get over this nightmare.,- You gotta be up,front with me Rachel,,at some point during,this conversation,,you must have had second,thoughts about Jacob.,Oh, I'm sorry, I meant Jake.,Don't apologize,,that was actually kind of funny.,But not even for,a fraction of a second.,- Yeah.,- He's really a decent guy,deep down, it's just,the idiot does not,know how to treat women.,- Yeah.,- I'm not a psychologist,or anything, but, if he,saw a therapist I'm sure,they would tell him that,,all this anger that he has,,that stems from the,abuse that he got from,our despicable mother.,- Well that sounds,right to me Dr. Phil.,- Excuse me.,- Okay.,Oh Miss Leno would,,don't don't please,don't slam the door,,please don't slam the door!,Please let me talk.,- All right.,Come on in.,- Thank you.,- Yeah just, follow me.,- Oh, I'm sorry, I,didn't mean to interrupt,,I didn't know you were--,- That's all right.,Detective Ryker I'd like,you to meet Darcy Miller.,- Excellent.,- She's a stringer with,,Crime Scene Magazine.,- Very nice to meet you.,- I called her editor, and,,it, she's the only,one that would come see me.,The fact that you showed,up here is actually,,pretty good timing.,- Well it's nice to,meet you Officer Ryker.,- My pleasure.,- Uh, it's not officer Darcy,,it's detective, that's,a distinction that he's,,he's worked long and hard for.,- That's true, thank you.,Um I thank you for that,distinction, I appreciate it.,Um, I want to ask you,a question Miss Leno,,and, and I don't mean to,,I don't mean to come off,like a dick, or anything,,but, why are you being so,cooperative with me right now?,Now last time, about,a week or so ago,,you were anything but.,You were almost combative.,So why all of a sudden,- Well because, because you,,-, it must be her?,- Well you were a dick!,You put me on the defensive,,you, had all the oddest,accusations about my brothers,,and I tried to keep my cool,,so, I, I slammed,the door on you.,But, look at this, you're,being very civil right now,,and I'll be very,civil, so we can just,get down to what we,were talking about.,I went and saw my brother,,I went up to his house.,- Whoa, whoa, wait wait, you,went to Jacob Leno's house?,It's uh, a week ago you,told me, you had no I,,wait a minute, you told me,you had no idea where he was,,you had, you, just, not a,clue and now all of a sudden,you went to his house.,- This, this is the attitude,I'm talking about, do, do,you want my help or not?,I'm, willing to help you!,- Of course I do.,But uh, all right, all,right, no attitude.,- Okay.,- We'll start over, um,,I'm sorry, please go on.,- Okay, thank you.,First of all, when you,speak to my brother,,you can not call him Jacob.,- Well what am I,supposed to call him?,- Well, you call him,Jake, I mean that's,a button you do not,want to push with him.,- Okay, okay.,You know something,,you could do yourself,,and your brother, and me,,a big favor if you would,,organize some kind of a,sit-down between the two of us.,- Well, that's exactly,,that's what I wanted to do!,- All right so let's do that.,- But I can't be responsible,for his attitude!,He is a serious whisky,drinker, and oh,,when he hits that,bottle, oh there's just--,- Just just, wait a,minute, wait a minute.,I've been on the,force for 39 years.,I've seen every kind of,crack whore, every kind of,psychotic junkie, you,name it, a lunatic pimp,,I think I can deal,with an alcoholic,okay, so don't--,- Okay.,- Hey, why don't you give him,a call, please please please.,- All right, okay.,- Oh, before you do it,,whatever you do don't tell,him that I'm here, all right?,I mean he doesn't need to--,-

times,have we talked about,girls that we know who've been,victims of physical abuse?,- Tons, like,,practically every day.,- Exactly, and you,and I both know,first-hand what that,horror looks like.,And I want to do,something to make it stop.,- But, like what Faith?,- I don't know like,,open a shelter,,or start a place where,we can teach women,how to avoid becoming victims,,not any kind of victim.,Not a victim of spousal,abuse, or a jealous boyfriend,,husband, not having to,deal with mental torment,,or living with a mean,alky, none of that.,- I mean, I hear you, I just,,I don't really know,what I could do to help,,you know, it's not like I,really have a mind for business.,You know, but hey,,maybe I could talk,to teenage girls, you know,,the ones right out,of high school.,- Uh-huh, yeah, that'd,be perfect Hope and--,- And I have an idea!,I think it's good.,- Oh yeah?,- Yeah.,- Let's hear it.,- If we're gonna go in on this,together, why don't we call,it Faith, Hope, and Charity?,- Oh my god!,Faith, Hope and Charity,,that's frikkin' brilliant!,That's it, that's what,we're calling it for sure!,And you know,,maybe we can stop,stripping for a living.,- Ah, that's,totally the idea.,- Wouldn't that be sweet.,- I'm so sick of doing this!,But you gotta admit,,where else can you,walk out of a job,on a Thursday night,with over 1000 bucks,in your pocket.,I'm sick of it but,,it might just be the,seed money we need for,Faith, Hope and Charity.,- You really like,that don't you?,- Heck yeah, and,speaking of cash,,who cares if strange guys,I'm never gonna see again,think all I am is tits,and ass without any class.,It makes me all the,more proud that I just,extract half their weekly,paycheck out of their wallet.,Those guys are like free ATMs.,- You're so funny.,But, you're right you know.,And you, are always,walking out of here,with the most money at,the end of the night.,Maybe it's because you,come off so confident.,I wish, I could be,more like that, I,,always sound really,pathetic and I'm like,,do you want another dance?,- Ah my girl, you're a pisser.,Well let's,get out of here.,- Um, actually, I have to run,to the bathroom real quick.,- Well that's cool, I can wait.,- You know what, I'm,gonna be a few minutes.,- Ah.,- All that pizza, so...,- All right, see you,tomorrow night Hope.,Bye!,- Hey partner.,No no, that's,all right, I had to...,Yeah.,Oh no,

partner.,You got a problem with that?,- Yeah I do, I got a,big problem with that.,- Oh yeah, well,what would that be?,- How long has this joker,been on a killing spree?,- Oh I don't know,,about three, four...,- That's just it, you don't,know, you don't know jack shit.,You got a trench,coat and a ski mask.,Other than that you,don't know anything,about this mother fucker.,Or than the fact that,he's using piano wire tied,to wooden handles to,behead his victims,,you've got nothing.,Stop me when I'm,saying something other,than the facts, Bolden.,- Wooden handles, oh.,Look, we're doing our best here.,Maybe that's why you guys,get the big bucks, huh?,So how long you been,with the bureau?,- 11 years, nine,months, and four days.,- Yeah but who's,counting, right?,- Yeah who's counting, right.,You fix the time of,death on this one?,- I'll give you an,exact time--,I'll give you an,exact time when we get,her back down to the morgue.,But for now, judging by,the stage of rigor mortis,,I'd put it real close to,four, six hours tops.,- That makes sense.,Club closes around two,a.m., this poor girl,is probably the last,dancer to leave.,- Yeah.,- Son of a bitch,knows his way,around these joints.,And so far he's,been able to stay,one step ahead of,the local efforts.,- Well you could add this,to the mix if you like.,The angle isn't nearly severe,,as the previous victims.,- And, and what,does that tell you?,- It leads me to,believe that this is,the same assailant,that garroted the heads,of the other women I examined,,and uh, I'm assuming,you're gonna be the one,making that determination.,- Well of course.,But tell me how you,came up with that?,- The closer to level the angle,,from the throat to,the back of the neck,,the closer the height,of the person wielding,the device is to,the victim's height.,In this case, she,was five foot eight.,Note the angle.,The other victims were,between five-four,,and five-six, again,,note the angle.,It's simple math.,All the angles are consistent,with the killer's height.,The angle here showed,that the killer is,approximately two inches,taller than this victim.,Therefor he, or she, stands,at five foot, 10 inches.,- Definitely adds up, thank you.,- Ah, I'm just doing my job.,- Aw, Jesus Al.,Another one?,Oh, who is this?,- Special Agent Sam Warden.,- Well it looks like we,hit the big time, huh?,Feds are back in town.,- Not a very glorious,distinction Ryker.,Not like you're hosting,another Superbowl or anything.,It's more like again.,- What's that supposed to mean?,- Truly it means that,neither one of you two,knew that the victim,was linked to the,sexual misconduct trial,of Congressman Waiverly.,And you, you and your partner--,Hey, wait wait wait wait,,my partner has a name, okay?,It's Al Bolden and he,and I have been partners,long before you became a,federale, okay Mr. Bigshot?,And I'm not talking about,Chauncey Billups either.,He doesn't get that,reference, obviously.,- Relax, Ryker.,- Because he's not,a Detroiter.,- As I was saying, because,this involves a congressman,,you are both officially,off this case,,effective immediately.,- Wait wait what, what?,- Off the case!,English not your,first language James?,I also speak fluent Spanish,or German, if that will help.,Oh really you,sarcastic!,- Relax, relax,,he's right you know,,come on, come on, we,don't have shit to go on!,Okay, that killer is still,at large and in charge.,Look, we don't even come close,to the resources the feds have.,Just let it go!,- Let it go, just like that?,Let it go?,- We don't have any choice!,- You wanna let it go!,- Jimmy!,Come on, this is one,time when we're gonna,have to turn this,over to the A-Team.,- Ah, Jesus.,- Look I'm sorry,,don't take it personal, I,know I sure as hell don't.,- Stay back sir!,What a mess eh?,- What a mess.,How do you get these,fucking gloves on?,You laugh, prick.,This is his first time?,- No, well I'm,usually the one to--,- You know he's,pushing his luck,,he's pushing his luck.,Oh.,Is your boy all right.,Oh jeez.,Fucking, what a pussy.,Big tough Detroit guy.,I'll be all right.,Big tough Detroit cop.,- Yeah I'll be all,right, oh shit fuck,,man.,Fuck, I don't,even feel bad for him.,What a--,- Look, I swear to you,we're gonna catch,this sick fucker.,- Yeah, yeah.,- Right?,Look.,I'm gonna get out of here man.,- All right.,- Maybe now this,motherfucker'll will,meet his match yet.,- Yeah ...,- Hey I'm sorry.,- All right.,- Oh, shit, unbelievable.,- I'm sorry for Ryker, he's,got a personal stake in this.,One of his lady friends fell,victim to that son of a bitch.,- Wow, that explains,his jumpy attitude.,Things are a hell of a lot,different when it gets personal,,man I've been there before.,- Yeah.,- You know um,,you talk to him, you let him,know I'm sorry for his loss.,- Okay.,- And Al,,we're gonna nail this five-ten,piece of shit to the wall.,- How do you know he's five-ten?,- Just doing my job.,Nice, just,catch this fucker, will you?,Promise me.,- We will, do me a favor.,Why don't you get,on out of here too,,no need to watch more blood,soak through that bag.,- Okay.,Call Rachel Leno.,Come on.,Calling Rachel,Leno, mobile, press the phone,hangup button to end the call.,- Yeah yeah yeah, I know,,I know, I know the rules,already Siri, every time.,Come on, come on.,Hey Jim,,how's it going?,- Hey, hey, Rachel, Rachel,,we're going tonight.,- Yeah.,- We're going tonight.,Listen, if you have any,,any qualms about it,,let me know now I'll be thank--,- Listen, hey, I'm your lure,dammit, we're gonna do this!,I'm ready.,- Are you home?,- I am.,- All right, listen--,- I'm about to leave.,- What?,What, I'm,about to leave but,,yeah, tell me what's up?,- Listen, b-but we gotta,go tonight, I'm, I'm 20,minutes away from you,,I'm by the airport.,Can you, can you,cancel the appointment?,- That's fine yes,,I will cancel,,this is more,important, gosh yes.,- Okay all right,,I'll be there in,less than 20 minutes, all right?,- All right, sounds good,,drive safely please.,- I will, we're,going tonight kid.,- Uh huh.,- All right, see you soon.,- All right, bye.,Tigers are,going to the World Series!,Yeah right.,God, hell of a time,you pick to have,the gate locked.,- I'm sorry.,- Jesus Christ I'm...,Jimmy,where are you going?,- Oh, I'm sorry,,I'm just, I'm so,,so hyped up, I'm sorry.,- Well you can sit down,,right here, sit.,- I got here fast, right?,- Yes, closer.,- Listen Rachel, we,gotta go tonight.,I'm not gonna lie to,you, what we're doing,,what I'm doing, is totally,interfering with the law.,Wait, look,,you are the law.,- Yeah yeah, we, uh yeah,,I am the law, yeah yeah.,- Then how, how are,you interfering?,That doesn't make any sense.,- It's not, not about our plan.,Look, we were taken,off the case today.,- What?,- You watch the news,,or hear any of the report?,- No, what?,- He killed another,dancer, late last night,,early this morning.,- What?,- Yeah I was, I was called down,to the crime scene by my,partner, Bolden, and uh,,- What is it?,- I saw her headless,body, Rachel, and uh,,I just, I puked my guts up.,- Oh.,- All over the alley and,,I haven't done that in,39 years on the force.,I, I don't,know, I'm losing it or,,I'm getting too old,for this shit I think.,You know, I just...,- But hey Jimmy wait,,Jimmy what?,Jimmy wait hey, they can't,take you off the case,just because you're human and,puked, I mean, that doesn't,sound right.,- No no no no no, that's,not why, that's not why,,the FBI's involved, okay?,When they say you're off the,case, you're off the case.,You got no choice, it's just,,- Well, I don't,,- it's as simple as that.,- Why don't we just,let them handle it?,You know, then we don't,have to do this whole,,charade thing here.,- Rachel, I have,a strong feeling,that I understand this,killer's line of thinking.,It's just, it's starting,to make sense to me.,Think about it, he's got,this pattern that he's on.,He's only killing,prostitutes and strippers,and--,- Well but,,Darcy wasn't either of those,,why would he kill Darcy?,- Okay, that's true, and,Bolden and I were talking,about that, Bolden,my partner, and,,we're figuring maybe,he's just changing his,MO up a little bit,to put us off track.,- Okay yeah.,- Okay,,does that make sense?,- Uh huh, uh huh.,I, I, I'm telling you,,I've got a line on him,,I know exactly, I think,I know exactly where,he's going next, and,I think he's gonna go,,you know, he goes,country, urban, country,,not country like hyuck,hyuck, but you know,,just away from the city.,He's due to hit tonight,again, I know it!,Look, if you don't want to do,this, I totally understand.,I'm gonna--,- Hey hey hey,,no, I'm all in on this, we,spent too much time on this,,it's just, I don't want,you getting in trouble.,- You're worried about me?,- Yes.,- Listen, people have a,way of turning a blind eye,when the bad guy goes,down, you understand?,- Yeah, I know what you mean.,- That's a chance that,I'm gonna take, and it's not,gonna be a chance for you,,because if push comes to shove,,I'm just gonna say I duped,you into it or conned you,,or some other, whatever.,- And I'm just gonna,act like I never,,heard any of that crap?,- What crap?,Look, I just want,to make sure that,you are perfectly,prepared, I don't want,any scenarios coming,up that's gonna,,I don't know, put,you in harms way.,Remember, I promised you with,my life that no harm would,come to you.,- You did.,- And I'm not gonna let,any harm come to you.,- Thank you, thank you Jim.,- So, very frankly,,I have to tell you,,you could use a little,more hooker helper.,- Seriously?,- Yes.,- Well, give it to me teach,,serve me up a heaping portion,,Another, another lesson, ok.,This is what I was,gonna do first okay?,- All right.,I was gonna,put a wire on you.,Just run a wire, just,- Okay.,Like up through,the back or whatever, okay?,- All right.,- And, then I got to thinking,,if he detects it, I may,not get to you in time,to come to your aid and--,- Yeah yeah yeah yeah,yeah, yeah, from where I'm,sitting that is not a good,idea, let's, n-no wire.,- Okay, okay, no wire.,- No wire.,- So, here's my other idea.,And you gotta forgive me for,pacing, but I'm just like,,I'm just,,- I get it.,I'm antsy, okay?,So, this is what we're gonna do.,We're gonna get, I'm,gonna get, a few girls,and we're going to,- Whoa!,- Drop them off where I think--,- No no stop!,What do you mean, girls?,This is supposed to be,my solo performance.,- Yeah yeah yeah.,- Hannah, Hooker Hannah,,this is my time.,- Yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's,- What are you talking about?,- Your time, it's your time.,All right, it's gonna be,your time, okay, I promise,,just, just hear me,out for a second okay?,- Okay okay, okay.,- All right.,I'm going to get,three other hookers,,so there'll be four total, you,count, you're my main hooker,,okay?,- Okay, okay.,- We're gonna get them,to, to, drop them off,at the same, the same spot,,- Uh-hmm.,- And eventually they're gonna,dwindle down just to you.,Let me explain a little bit,about how prostitutes work, ok?,- Okay.,- They're, prostitutes are,a lot like, like piranhas,,- Right, 'cause they,,chew men, take big,bites out of 'em?,- No no,,- What is it?,- Yeah and that's a,good one though no, no.,Because they travel,in packs, okay?,I would say they travel in,schools, but I don't want,to insult piranhas, 'cause,they're a lot smarter,than most of the,hookers I've met.,- Oh well ha ha ha, very funny,,I like the little fish story.,- Thank you.,- I'm not a cop, but,,this whole thing is, are you,overthinking it a little bit?,- Why do you say that?,- It kind'a sounds like you're,maybe trying to protect me.,Because if that's the case,Jim, I am psyched for this!,Real, I haven't even slept since,we first even brought,this up, and I'm,,I've been prancing around my,house like Sally Strumpet.,Shades up, I'm--,- Shades up?,I guess, I...,I'm right, I can do this,Jim, I really, I can.,- You, you just,amaze me Miss Leno.,You truly do, and yes,,that's mostly why,I was concerned.,I was, wanting to,- I, I thought so.,Make sure you were protected.,All right, so uh, we'll,just go with plan A then.,- Yeah, yep.,- Okay, sounds good.,- Lets, lets, I'm all brushed,up on all my expressions.,- Yeah you sure are.,- And I can, I can guarantee,that he'll think he picked,up the hookeriest hooker,that ever walked the seediest,sidewalk in the deep.,- All right.,- Right.,- I like that.,- I don't, there's one,,one thing that's been,kind of bugging me.,- And, what's that?,How am I gonna,know if it's the real killer?,I mean his car's--,- All right no, that's,,that's, that's a good question.,Look inside, and look,for a trench coat.,If the dude's wearing,a trench coat,,that's more than likely,our guy, 'cause he's the,only psycho that's,gonna be wearing a,trench coat in the,middle of the summer.,- But what if he only,wears a trench coat,when he kills them--,- Rachel, Rachel, Rachel!,You're getting cold,feet, no no, I can tell,,I can tell.,You can't afford to do,that, you can't act scared.,If you act scared, this could,all turn out really badly.,I'm not scared,because I'm prepared,,I just asked a simple question.,It

to happen.,He was trying to,impress me and I,,I let it go on for a,while, but then he tried,to take me to a really,dim corner on the,side of the building.,I was very uncomfortable,,and I turned to leave,,but he pulled me anyway.,As he was pointing,out one of the yachts,,I turned around and saw,a man wearing a trench,coat with a hoody,,and when I looked,back he was gone.,Ignored me,so I took off
